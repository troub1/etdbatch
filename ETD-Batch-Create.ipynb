Essential oils are plant secondary metabolites with characteristic odors. Essential oils are reported to alter ruminal fermentation (Hart et al., 2008) and animal performance (Calsamiglia et al., 2007). There is also evidence to suggest that EOs may manipulate feeding behavior in cattle (Tager and Krause, 2011). An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of a blend of EO in a commercially available complete feed (MFA Cattle Charge, MFA Inc., Columbia, MO) on performance, health, and feeding behavior of steers during the backgrounding phase. Eighty beef steers (initial BW = 267 [plus or minus] 2.6 kg) were obtained from 3 different sources and assigned risk groups based on distance traveled, previous health management, and incidence of disease. Pen fed EO tended (P = 0.09) to have a greater DMI than control. After 56 days on feed, steers exposedto moderate stress and fed EO had greater BW than steers exposed to moderate stress and fed control, but EO had no impact on final BW among steers exposed to small or large amounts of stress. Addition of EO did not have an effect on concentrations of anti-egg albumin IgG (P = 0.99). Under conditions of this experiment, inclusion of essential oils in a complete feed appeared to improve dry matter intake and weight gain in calves during the backgrounding phase. Meal intervals among calves in this study was 28 minutes and 40 seconds between the end time of a feeding event and start time of the next feeding event. Addition of EO to a complete feed influenced feeding rate through an interaction between treatment and days on feed (P = 0.02). Specifically, feeding rate was greater on days 11 and 44 in steers offered EO than steers offered control. Addition of EO to a complete feed may improve animal performance, health, and feeding behavior but under the conditions of this experiment, cattle source influenced the response to EO supplementation.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Animal Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88081</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88081</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Carson M.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Andersen</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Thomas</given_name>\\n      <surname> Jordan</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Evaluation of the 7 and 7 synch protocol for control of the estrous cycle among beef cows prior to fixed-time artificial insemination with sex-sorted or conventional semen</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Experiment 1 was conducted to compare 7 and 7 Synch and the 7-day CO-Synch + controlled internal drug release (CIDR[copyright]) protocols prior to fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) of beef cows with conventional or sex-sorted semen. Cows (n = 1,538) were blocked based on age and days postpartum (DPP) and randomly assigned to protocol and semen type. Cows assigned to 7-day CO-Synch + CIDR (n = 769) received administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and insertion of an intravaginal progesterone-releasing insert (CIDR) on Day -10, and administration of prostaglandin F2[alpha] (PG) coincident with CIDR removal on Day -3. Cows assigned to 7 and 7 Synch (n = 769) received PG and insertion of CIDR on Day -17, GnRH on Day -10, and PG coincident with CIDR removal on Day -3. Estrus detection aids were applied to all cows. Cows received FTAI 66 h after CIDR removal with conventional (20 x 106 cells per unit) or sex-sorted (4 x 106 cells per unit) semen. Estrus expression was affected by protocol (P = 0.01) by protocol x DPP (P = 0.0004), with 7 and 7 Synch (82 percent; 629/769) resulting in a greater proportion of cows expressing estrus (82 percent [629/769] versus 64 percent [492/769]), especially among cows with greater DPP. Pregnancy rates to FTAI were reduced (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) when using sex-sorted semen but greater among cows treated with 7 and 7 Synch (conventional semen: 72 percent [280/389]; sex-sorted semen: 52 percent [199/380]) compared with 7-day CO-Synch + CIDR (conventional semen: 61 percent [233/383]; sex-sorted semen: 44 percent [171/386]). Experiment 2 was designed to evaluate later timing of fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) with sex-sorted semen among postpartum beef cows following the 7 and 7 Synch protocol, with the hypothesis that later timing would result in increased pregnancy rates (P/AI) among cows that expressed estrus prior to FTAI. Beef cows (n=414) were blocked based on age and days postpartum (DPP) and randomly assigned to receive FTAI at 66 or 72 h after administration of prostaglandin F2[alpha] (PG). Estrus was synchrized using the 7 and 7 Synch protocol, which consists of administration of PG (500 [mu]g cloprostenol) and insertion of an intravaginal progesterone-releasing insert (CIDR; 1.38 g progesterone) on Day 0, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH; 100 [mu]g gonadorelin) on Day 7, and PG coincident with CIDR removal on Day 14. Estrus detection aids (EstrotectTM) were applied to all cows on Day 14, and activation status was recorded at fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) on Day 17. All cows that expressed estrus prior to FTAI received sex-sorted semen (4 x 106 cells per unit; SexedULTRA 4MTM). The proportion of cows expressing estrus prior to FTAI did not differ between treatments at this power of test (66 h: 71 percent [146/205]; 72 h: 76 percent [158/209]). Additionally, P/AI of estrous cows inseminated with sex-sorted semen did not differ between treatments (66 h: 45 percent [68/146]; 72 h: 40 percent [63/158]). In conclusion, later timing of FTAI following the 7 and 7 Synch protocol failed to improve P/AI of estrous cows inseminated h sex-sorted semen.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Animal Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88082</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88082</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Thomas</given_name>\\n      <surname>Cain</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Lupo</given_name>\\n      <surname> Anthony</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>The variability of the El Nino southern oscillation and Modoki mode and their impacts on New York state climate</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has long been an influential climate and weather driver for many regions. Many studies have examined the variability of the phases of ENSO, leading to discovery of a separate mode of El Nino dubbed the El Nino Modoki, featuring a tripole Walker circulation. However, few studies have examined the variability of El Nino with Modoki separated from regular El Nino events. The goals of this study were to demonstrate that the El Nino signal was stronger separate from Modoki (thus leading to higher predictability), and to examine the effect of the Modoki on both a national and regional level, showing the connection between other teleconnections such as the Pacific North American teleconnection (PNA), the Arctic Oscillation (AO), and the North American Oscillation teleconnection (NAO). Using NCEP/NCAR composites, conventional El Nino events were found to have a stronger signal, with persistent features being easier to identify. Similarly, the Modoki showed a pattern thatmilar but different to the regular El Nino. Using New York State for the area of regional analysis, all ENSO phases were found to modify the effect of the PNA, but the effect was different depending on location. Both of these results indicate that it is possible to generate a clearer picture of the impacts of ENSO by properly classifying these events</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Soil, Environmental and Atmospheric Sciences/Natural Resources</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88083</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88083</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Jason</given_name>\\n      <surname>Couto</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Donnelly</given_name>\\n      <surname> Lindsay</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Prospective evaluation of the fecal microbiome in dogs with large-cell lymphoma receiving chop chemotherapy</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The fecal microbiome composition has been associated with reduced efficacy of cancer therapy and adverse side effects in humans, and chemotherapy has been shown to alter the gut microbiome. The relationship between microbiota and chemotherapy efficacy and tolerability has not been investigated in dogs. We aimed to evaluate changes in fecal microbial diversity during a cycle of CHOP chemotherapy in dogs with lymphoma and whether these changes correlated with adverse events or treatment response. Eighteen dogs with lymphoma were prospectively enrolled, and stool samples were acquired weekly for 6 weeks during CHOP. Fecal samples was analyzed via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing as previously described. Treatment-associated differences in richness, alpha and beta diversity were determined through comparison to data from healthy controls (n = 26) using factorial ANOVA and PERMANOVA. Dogs with lymphoma had decreased fecal microbial diversity when compared with healthy controls at baseline and throughout treatment (p= 0.0002, 0.0003, 0.0001). Alpha and beta diversity did not significantly change in dogs throughout a cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (p = 0.520 and 0.995). Samples pre-treated with antibiotics were significantly less diverse (alpha and beta diversity) than untreated samples (p = 0.002, 0.0001 respectively). Dogs with lymphoma and fecal samples under the presence of antibiotics had higher levels of Escherchia species in their feces compared to normal dogs. The fecal microbiome of healthy dogs and dogs with lymphoma receiving CHOP is relatively stable over time, but dogs with lymphoma have reduced microbial diversity compared to healthy dogs before and during treatment. An increase in Proteobacteria abundance during treatment may be related to chemotherapy and/or antibiotic use.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Biomedical Sciences/Veterinary Medicine and Surgery</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88084</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88084</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Sara</given_name>\\n      <surname>Kasukurthy</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Sheets</given_name>\\n      <surname> Lincoln</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Comparison of simple moving average and arima timeseries forecasting models on independent historic data and extrapolating echo program attendance</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Background: The Extension of Community Healthcare Outcome program (ECHO) is an educational and training telemedicine service that provides voluntary case-based learning opportunities for healthcare professionals. Prediction of participant attendance will be useful to improve the sessions with early requirements to maximize the benefits. Usually, the most sophisticated Auto Regressive models are used for forecasting, when the data contains observation with multiple variables and dependencies, Simple Moving Average (SMA) models are used less in such conditions. In this study we want to examine the accuracy and reliability of Moving Average models compared with Auto Regressive models. The objective of this work is to develop an accurate forecasting model for ECHO program attendance by considering non-stationary, independent organizational data. Methods: The study analyzed 2015-2019 Show Me ECHO attendance data from the Missouri Telehealth Network (MTN). The first step; trained and tested both SMA and ARIMA predictive models without any dependent variables and evaluated both models by measuring error values. The second step; used the best model to forecast ECHO attendance for years 2020 - 2025. Results: The SMA model was better than the ARIMA model for independent data with lower error values MAE - 38.9, MSE - 2552.15, MAPE - 32.9 percent, p- value: 3.36E-28, and higher R - square: 87 percent. Where ARIMA model was with higher error values MAE - 61.8, MSE - 7198.88, MAPE - 37.7 percent, p- value: 6.25E-22, and lower R - square: 80 percent. Conclusion: Simple Moving Average (SMA) is more accurate than Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in forecasting future ECHO program attendance.

For shared resource systems where decision making is increasingly democratized, agencies engage stakeholders to document local understandings of physical processes useful for resource management. For a variety of fiscal, logistical, and policy reasons, most studies are snapshots in time with few agencies able to devote resources for longitudinal studies. Yet for large river systems that regularly change with floods, drought, and floodplain development cycles, one-off social studies are unable to respond to such human- environment dynamism. To explore longitudinal human-water dynamics in the Yellowstone River reach in Montana (US), this study uses interviews with 15 individuals interviewed in 2006, 2012, and 2018 field seasons. The Yellowstone River is the largest undammed river in the US. It is located in the arid Western United States, and experiences annual flooding from mountain snowmelt, regular drought cycles, increased water use from floodplain development, irrigation, and recreation. Interviewees had a history of involvement with the Yellowstone River decision making and/or were riverfront landowners each with the capacity to shape the physical features of this system. This study takes a scholarly approach to expressed participant concerns as empirical evidence that reflects the socio-hydrological phenomenon occurring in the Yellowstone River Valley. Analysis of stakeholder accounts of physical processes pay special attention to expressions of how they understand the physical processes (flood, drought, and erosion) and how they express it should be managed. The benefit of engaging the same stakeholders with the same questions in 2006, 2012, and 2018 affords attention to any patterns of change over time concerning stakeholders&apos; descriptions of riverine processes. Ultimately, this study brings clarity to the place-based phenomenon taking place in t Yellowstone River through a longitudinal comparative analysis.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Human Dimensions of Natural Resources/Natural Resources</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88086</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88086</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Emily C.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Kinzinger</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>North</given_name>\\n      <surname> Rebecca</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Assessing the occurrence of cyanotoxins in two urban reservoirs through a community science monitoring program</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Cyanobacterial blooms are an ongoing threat to aquatic systems worldwide. These potentially toxic blooms have typically been observed in summer to early fall, but there are increasing reports of blooms in colder seasons. From the few studies available, weknow that blooms can produce toxins in the winter. The objective of this research was to assess the year-round presence, concentration, and environmental drivers of the cyanotoxins microcystin and cylindrospermopsin in two reservoirs located in Columbia, Missouri, USA. To fulfill this objective, I coordinated and managed the Reservoir Observer Student Scientists (ROSS) program. This community science initiative combined educating high school students about limnology and cyanobacterial blooms with training students hands-on to collect weekly water quality samples. Data for this project was collected over two years in Bethel Lake and one year in Stephens Lake. We found detectable concentrations of the cyanotoxins year-round. There was no relationship between microcystin nor cylindrospermopsin and chlorophyll-a in either reservoir. Presence and concentration of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin were related to physical water quality parameters in Bethel Lake. This study provides evidence for the necessity of year-round water quality monitoring.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Water Resources/Natural Resources</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88087</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88087</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Tolulope Adewale</given_name>\\n      <surname>Kudoro</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Khanna</given_name>\\n      <surname> Sanjeev</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Application of microturbines in improving the energy efficiency of municipal wastewater treatment plants in Missouri.</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Hydropower is a source of renewable energy. It is possible to combine a hydropower installation with an existing wastewater plant while ensuring it still performs its basic purpose. The multipurpose scheme would be integrated into the facility to generate hydropower while also fulfilling its primary role of treating wastewater. The wastewater plant can generate renewable energy and benefit from introducing microturbines. The turbine system is moved by the power in the flowing treated water that is transformed into mechanical energy which rotates the generator and in turn generates electrical power. In this work, the potential for power generation from the energy in the outflow along with the economics of the system in wastewater plants in the state of Missouri was investigated to improve the energy efficiency of the municipal wastewater treatment plants. Data like the daily flow rate, speed of flow, available head, etc about the wastewater plants in Missouri were collected and some interviews held with plant managers of the wastewater treatment plants. The investigation revealed that there are 127 wastewater treatment plants in the state of Missouri with 32 plants discharging less than 1 Mgd, 74 plants discharging between 1 Mgd and 5 Mgd, 13 plants discharging between 5 Mgd and 20 Mgd while just 8 plants had an outflow between 20 Mgd and 120 Mgd range. The flowrate helps in calculating and determining the theoretical and actual amount of power that can be gotten from the micro hydropower system in the wastewater treatment plant. For the actual amount of power gotten, the efficiency factor (efficiency of the turbine, and efficiency of the generator) of the generating system is considered. A brief study on the turbine system was conducted and a crossflow turbine was selected as the most suitable for the wastewater treatment plant as a vast majority of them had low head and high flow capacity. The analysis showed that out of the 127 wastewater treatment plants in the state of Missouri, only 21 treatment plants have the maximum potential to generate power and reduce operating costs. Also, two plants were selected for case studies. The operating cost is reduced because of the decrease in demand for electrical power from the grid. The 21 treatment plants have a daily outflow between 5Mgd to 120Mgd and could produce power through an axial flow turbine that utilizes the kinetic energy in the flow volume.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88088</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88088</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Tiantian</given_name>\\n      <surname>Li</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Cho</given_name>\\n      <surname> Seonghee</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Hotel job characteristics in china and the United States, an application of the job characteristics model to turnover intention</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This study investigated hotel employees&amp;apos; job characteristics, their critical psychological states, and their relationship with the hotel employees&apos; turnover intention using the complete Hackman and Oldham&apos;s job characteristics model. In addition, it further compared the cultural differences between China and the United States. The survey was distributed to hotel employees in China and the United States. Descriptive analysis and path analysis were used to interpret the data. The finding of this research provided the in-depth knowledge of hotel employees&amp;apos; job characteristics. Including all three critical psychological states enhanced our understanding of the interrelationship between the five core job characteristics and the turnover intention. The significant mediating role of the critical psychological states between the relationship of five core job characteristics and the hotel employees&apos; turnover intention was confirmed in this research.

Fungicides in the quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) class are most effective in controlling C. sojina in the field. Unfortunately, azoxystrobin fungicide-resistant isolates of C. sojina have been recovered in many soybean growing areas of the U.S. Fungicide-resistant isolates of C. sojina were first detected in 2011 and 2012 in two counties in southeast Missouri, but no further assessment was conducted. In this study, 121 isolates were collected from 15 surveyed counties between 2019 and 2020 in an effort to understand the geographical distribution of fungicide-resistant C. sojina. Isolates were collected from fields based on the presence of frogeye leaf spot symptoms. Samples were brought to the laboratory and isolates were recovered from individual lesions. A fungicide sensitivity bioassay was conducted to determine which isolates were resistant to the QoI class of fungicides. The fungicide sensitivity bioassay consisted of full-strength PDA amended with technical grade azoxystrobin at five different concentrations and a no fungicide control. Out of 121 isolates, 81 were fungicide-resistant representing 13 of the 15 Missouri counties included in the survey. Notably, the northwest corner of Missouri had the highest concentration of fungicide-resistant isolates, consistent with the recent recovery of fungicide-resistant C. sojina isolates in Iowa and Nebraska. The widespread recovery of fungicide-resistant C. sojina in multiple counties throughout Missouri provides new insight into disease management in the state.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Plant Insect and Microbial Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88090</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88090</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Anna</given_name>\\n      <surname>Moritz</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Youn</given_name>\\n      <surname> Song-yi</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Spatial ability of transitioning 2d to 3d apparel design : applying apparel spatial visualization test (asvt) into virtual environment</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The purpose of this was to develop a 3D Apparel Spatial Visualization Test to examine visualization skills and mental imagery in a virtual prototyping environment of students who major in textile apparel management at the college level. By examining the visualization skills and mental imagery in a virtual prototyping, this research sought to understand how 3D ASVT training could influence student&apos;s performance in a product development course. It also sought to examine how experience level (i.e.., number of courses a student has taken) effects performance on 3D ASVT. Results from this study indicated there was no relationship among general spatial ability tests and the developed 3D ASVT. Generally speaking, the study found that the number of product development courses taken positively influence scores on 3D ASVT; and there was not a significant difference among number of courses taken and performance.

Thus, the number of socially responsible fashion brands are increasing day by day. Statistics show that consumers&apos; now demand more eco-friendly products. However, literature also suggests that consumers&apos; purchasing behavior show dissimilarity while buying products from socially responsible brands. This study was designed to examine consumers&apos; belief from an environmental perspective and to identify the mediating effect of consumers&apos; expectation of CSR communication in the effect of consumers&apos; environmental belief on purchase intention. From previous literatures, an online survey was developed. Consumers ages over 18 and living in the US participated in the survey in Amazon Mechanical Turk. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on all items of measurement scales for all variables to check the factor loadings. Scale reliability was also checked. Mediation analysis was conducted to test the hypothesis. Corralysis was also used. Based on the result of this research, companies may get rid of the promotional tone from their marketing policy. Also, as the result showed that factual tone has the biggest impact on the environmental belief of consumers towards purchasing fashion products, the marketers may focus more on factual tone in their marketing or ad creating policy. Future research is mainly suggested to explore all other CSR communication factors. Contributions, implications, limitations and other future scopes are also discussed.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Textile and Apparel Management</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88092</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88092</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Tiffany</given_name>\\n      <surname>Nguyen</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Luisi</given_name>\\n      <surname> Monique</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Exploring cancel culture and the distrust of YouTube influencers</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">YouTube is the third most visited website in the world after Google and Facebook, and the second most visited social media platform after Facebook (Khan, 2017). As over 90 percent of 18- to 24-year-old U.S. American internet users use YouTube (Chen, 2020), this study tackles how individuals between in this age group view their role within cancel culture, specifically on the YouTube platform. A qualitative approach, collecting data from 5 focus groups, allowed for points on cancel culture and the James Charles and Tati Westbrook case to surface. Findings showed that many participants don&apos;t believe that cancel culture is a beneficial aspect of the culture on the platform but believe that it can be necessary in some cases. Participants elaborated on their own experiences on YouTube, explaining their thoughts and beliefs as it came to cancel culture on the platform. This study attempts to fulfill a literature gap due to no clear prior research on cancel culture. The research focuses on the audience role and their effe on cancel culture in the YouTube space.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Journalism/Strategic Communication-Distance</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.A.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88105</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88105</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Erin Louise</given_name>\\n      <surname>Petty</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>North</given_name>\\n      <surname> Rebecca</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>An assessment of the light and nutrient regimes constraining phytoplankton dynamics in Missouri reservoirs</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Worldwide, nutrient pollution, or eutrophication, is one of the most pervasive environmental issues threatening water quality. Anthropogenic influences, primarily urbanization and agriculture, have drastically increased inputs of bioavailable nutrients to surface water resources, such as lakes and reservoirs. Excessive phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in these waters amplify the growth of suspended algae, or phytoplankton, resulting in unsightly, sometimes odorous, cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) that further degrade water quality and potentially endanger human and animal health. As global climate change increases surface water temperatures, promotes water column stability, and drives down bottom-water oxygen concentrations, environmental conditions are also becoming more favorable for CyanoHABs. With eutrophication prevailing and CyanoHABs increasing in frequency, intensity, and distribution around the globe, I seek to further understand the role of light and nutrients as limiting agents for phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity across Midwestern reservoirs. I utilize numerous lines of evidence to create a robust assessment exploring the influences of climate, eutrophication, and land-use on the proximate light and nutrient status of phytoplankton in 32 Missouri reservoirs. Through observation and experimentation, deficiencies of light, P, and N are evaluated using general indicators of water quality and physiological stress, including mixed layer irradiance, nutrient stoichiometry/debts, photosynthetic efficiency, and the photosynthetic-irradiance (P-E) parameters. Ultimately, I determine if phytoplankton biomass and productivity are constrained by light, P, N, or a combination thereof, across gradients of trophic status and land-use within the context of two contrasting wet and dry summers. As expected, higher proportions of agricultural land-use correspond with higher total in-reservoir nutrient concentrations. Despite agricultural prevalence, however, bioavailable N concentrations in the mixed layer are, overall, relatively low. Yet, P-deficiency is more prominent than either N- or light-deficiency. For the 2018 season, I estimate nearly half of all samples to be P-deficient, with fewer than 20 percent suggesting alternative deficiency or co-deficiency combinations, and approximately one-third indicating sufficiency in both light and nutrients. Primary productivity demonstrates negative relationships with nutrients, biomass, and turbidity, and positive relationships with light. Thus, productivity is highest in clear, low-nutrient reservoirs where light utilization efficiency is also highest. Overall, in Missouri reservoirs, phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity are constrained by P and light, respectively. If current conditions in Missouri reservoirs are at all indicative of those to come as surface waters are further affected by climate change and eutrophication, both P and light will be important regulators of phytoplankton dynamics and subsequent water quality. Contributing to the ongoing P vs NP nutrient management debate, these results both support and challenge aspects of the traditional P-paradigm of limitation on phytoplankton dynamics. It underscores the importance of P control in reservoirs, while offering support for additional consideration of light and N. Having critical implications for watershed management throughout the region, these results are particularly useful within watersheds experiencing high agricultural nutrient loading. Results inform resource managers seeking to employ more effective strategies to control phytoplankton biomass, avoiding harmful regime shifts and CyanoHAB development. Additionally, results may inform lawmakers and regulators developing policies and standards to mitigate nutrient pollution and its effects on water quality at the local, regional, and, potentially, global scales.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Water Resources/Natural Resources</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88106</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88106</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Madeline</given_name>\\n      <surname>Pringle</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Mesenbach</given_name>\\n      <surname> Rebecca</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Sensemaking and identity management amidst major organizational change</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Organizational change is inevitable and its impacts will affect all members, albeit to different degrees. These changes also bring about uncertainty, especially as it pertains to one&apos;s organization-based identities. However, when studying change and identity, organizational communication scholars have often missed studying the interplay of one&apos;s many organization-based identities and how these are made sense of and managed amidst major organizational change. This thesis employs a phronetic-iterative methodology to analyze 16 semi-structured interviews with U.S. graduate students to understand how they have made sense of and managed their organization-based (i.e., graduate student, teaching assistant/instructor, department, university) identities after the COVID-19-induced transition to fully online education in Spring 2020. Analysis of this data suggested that participants used two types of ideal self discursive resources to make sense of and manage these identities, while also experiencing their sensemaking and identity management processes in two distinct stages. Additionally, participants revealed the importance of organizational places as it pertained to making sense of this change and its impacts. With these findings, this thesis extends theoretical work surrounding sensemaking, identity, and place, especially as it pertains to organizational change and providespractical recommendations for organizational leaders in academia to assist some of their highly impacted and identity-precarious populations--graduate students.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Communication</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.A.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88107</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88107</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Samuel Brian</given_name>\\n      <surname>Ritter</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Fox</given_name>\\n      <surname> Neil</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Assessing fall velocity-maximum dimension relationships and particle size distributions for snowfall</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Snowfall is an atmospheric phenomenon that can cause significant impacts to many aspects of daily life in Missouri. Further, no two snowfall events are exactly the same, as even small differences in environmental characteristics can result in differing snow crystal types dominating the event, which in turn can result in differing impacts from event to event. Therefore, it is necessary to understand snowfall behavior so that better forecasts and in situ analyses may be made. In this study, snowflake maximum dimension and fall velocity measurements were recorded using the OTT Parsivel Laser Disdrometer. In conjunction with distribution of measured maximum dimensions, RAP Analysis soundings were used to determine snow crystal type. From there, the relationships between fall velocity and maximum dimension and the particle size distributions of snowflakes from many snowfall events were analyzed. Observed relationships between fall velocity and maximum dimension were compared with previously derived relationships, and it was found that, in most cases, no single curve represented the relationship in the observed data well, with discrepancies caused by instrumentation error and lack of a single dominant crystal type. To analyze particle size distributions, several distribution functions were fit to the observed distribution using a least-squares regression method in MATLAB. It was found that, overall, the triple Gaussian distribution function performed the best in modeling particle size distributions in snow, but there were some instances where the gamma function modeled the distribution best. Further study, especially with the inclusion of field observations in addition to instrument observations, is necessary to develop a better understanding of these snowfall events.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Soil, Environmental and Atmospheric Sciences/Natural Resources</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88108</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88108</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Amanda L.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Schmelzle</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Green</given_name>\\n      <surname> Jonathan</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Effects of bovine pregnancy-associated glycoproteins on gene transcription in bovine endometrial explants</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) are a complex gene family, whose members are expressed by trophoblasts of ruminants and related species. In cattle, the PAGs accumulate at the trophoblast-uterine interface and many can enter the maternal circulation. However, very little is known about the role they play in pregnancy although preliminary results suggest that PAGs at the placenta-uterine interface play roles involving matrix turnover and immune modulation. This study was designed to provide further insight into the biological roles of bovine PAGs by measuring changes in endometrial transcript abundance for some matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and chemokines/cytokines. PAGs for these experiments were purified from mid-gestation bovine placental extracts by affinity chromatography. Heifers were synchronized and bred by artificial insemination with high fertility semen (n = 14) or dead semen (n = 5). Heifers were slaughtered at day 18 post-insemination and the reproductive tracts were obtained and flushed to determine if a conceptus was present. Endometrial explants were collected and split between 4 groups: pregnant with and without 15 [mu]g/ml PAG (n = 10) and nonpregnant with and without 15 [mu]g/ml PAG (n = 9). Endometrial explants were cultured with or without added PAGs for up to 96 hours at 37 degreesC and 5 percent CO2 and samples were harvested at 24 hour intervals for extraction of RNA and fixation. This study focuses on the 48 and 72 hour collection points. Transcript abundance for target genes was analyzed in the endometrial tissue by quantitative PCR. The normalization control transcript was peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA). After 48 and 72 hours, significant increases in CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 as well as MMP1, MMP3 and MMP13 were measured in the PAG-treated endometrium from both pregnant and non-pregnant animals (P&lt;0.05). CCL11 was upregulated at both time points in the pregnant endometrium but only after 72 hours in the nonpregnant endometrium. There were also significant decreases in message for CCL2, CCL8d CCL16 in the PAG-treated groups from both pregnant and non-pregnant animals at each time point (P&lt;0.05). Significant decreases in CXCL10, CXCL12, and Regakine message were seen only in PAG-treated endometrium from pregnant animals (P&lt;0.05). Structural differences in the luminal and glandular epithelium were seen in the PAG-treated biopsies from both non-pregnant and pregnant heifers. These results suggest that PAGs are capable of inducing structural changes as well as changes in transcript abundance in bovine endometrial explants, which suggests that this model system might be useful to assess PAG function at the placenta-uterine interface.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Animal Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88109</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88109</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Lydia</given_name>\\n      <surname>Schreiber</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>McGarvey</given_name>\\n      <surname> Ronald G.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Assessing costs and environmental impacts of municipal food waste treatment options in Columbia, Missouri : a decision support tool integrating life cycle analysis and robust optimization</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Many municipal governments currently have goals in place to align with global efforts and policy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions and take advantage of waste as a resource for renewable energy and nutrients. To meet specified goals and targets, decisionmakers need data-driven analysis to understand both the costs and environmental impacts of their plans. This study develops a decision support tool applied in Columbia, Missouri, USA, with aims to model the economic and environmental tradeoffs in solid waste management decisions for the collection and treatment of food waste in the municipal solid waste stream while considering existing infrastructure and uncertainty in environmental impact data. The tool uses life cycle analysis environmental impact data from literature and cost data from case-studies to simulate both a FW collection route and the processing of FW through various potential and existing treatment options (anaerobic digestion, anaerobic co-digestion with sewage sludge, composting, landfilling, dry animal feed production, wet animal feed production). The model calculates the cost and greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation and treatment processes in each simulation. The tool can choose the best FW management scenario for the objective of minimizing cost or minimizing GHG emissions. Robust optimization incorporates uncertainty into the model by allowing environmental impacts for any FW treatment option to assume a maximum or minimum of a range of values from literature, representing the worst- and best-case values for environmental performance, respectively. Average case results indicate that a minimum cost scenario uses a combination of landfilling and composting FW that results in net positive GHG emissions. To minimize environmental impact, the average case results favor anaerobic digestion, a scenario which results in net negative GHG emissions. Compared to the minimum cost scenario, the transportation costs in the minimum impact scenario are similar, while the costs to treat the FW are nearly nine times higher. Robust results focus on variability in environmental impacts. In the model results, anaerobic digestion is favored when assuming its minimum environmental impact value but is outperformed by other options when anaerobic digestion assumes the maximum of its possible range. All considered options outperform landfilling, but the rankings among landfilling alternatives depend highly on assumptions regarding offsets estimated in life cycle assessment. Without any offsets, wet animal feed production is the best FW treatment solution. Environmental impact of transportation in this model is not influential. The results demonstrate the importance of model assumptions, uncertainty in life cycle GHG estimates, and consideration of existing infrastructure in determining the optimal scenarios.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Industrial Engineering</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88110</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88110</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Madelyn</given_name>\\n      <surname>Spooner</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Patterson</given_name>\\n      <surname> Amanda</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>A reappraisal of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition within the endometrium</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">A controversial topic, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) is thought to be a mechanism involved in regeneration of the uterine epithelial layer following pregnancy and menstruation. Little is known about this process though, requiring further exploration. Previously, MET was thought to only occur as a damage-repair mechanism following parturition and menses-like events in mouse models. However, in the current study we hypothesized that MET would also occur in other endometrial epithelialization events as a mechanism of homeostatic epithelial turnover. To identify mesenchymal-derived cells within the adult uterine epithelium, an Amhr2-Cre; Rosa26-EYFP reporter mouse line was used. Mice were staged by vaginal cytology prior to the isolation of uterine epithelial and stromal cells, which were then stained with EpCAM to identify epithelial cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. EpCAM+YFP+ cells were identified in all stages of the estrous cycle except diestrus, indicating a proportion of epithelial cells were derived from the stroma (i.e., mesenchyme). Up to 80 percent of the uterine epithelia was EpCAM+YFP+ during estrogen-dominant stages (proestrus and estrus) of the cycle, with negligible amounts found during progesterone-dominant stages (metestrus and diestrus), suggesting this population may be responsive to estrogen. Uteri were also evaluated direct fluorescence and immunofluorescence in tissue sections. Immunofluorescence for EpCAM, forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), Ki67, estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), and progesterone receptor (PGR) was performed to assess epithelial characteristics and potential functionality. To further investigate the role of MET in epithelialization and assess the temporal origin of mesenchymal-derived epithelial cells, we evaluated key postnatal (P) developmental time points using Amhr2-Cre; Rosa26-tTA; H2B-GFP reporter mice. Flow cytometry data indicated that MET may initially occur immediately after birth at P 0.5, with results varying from negligible amounts (0.21 percent) to approximately 82 percent. Similar results were found at P 3, but with decreasing variation; the highest EpCAM+GFP+ population representing approximately 50 percent of the epithelium. Between P 3 and early adenogenesis at P 8, this population decreased to average less than 2 percent. By the completion of adenogenesis initiation at P 14, approximately 10 percent of epithelial cells were EpCAM+GFP+, suggesting MET may occur during adenogenesis initiation and is maintained through P 21. Together, these results suggest that MET may be a more ubiquitous mechanism of epithelialization than originally thought and is likely hormone regulated. This research will help elucidate the role of MET in uterine epithelialization with potential for insights into dysregulation of MET in diseases such as endometrial adenocarcinoma and endometriosis.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Animal Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88111</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88111</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Monica P.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Strawn</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Behura</given_name>\\n      <surname> Susanta K.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Molecular regulation of fetal brain development in pigs</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Two experiments were conducted to investigate molecular regulation that impacts fetal brain development in pigs. In the first experiment (Chapter 2), gene expression was profiled by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to examine the whole transcriptome of the male (M) and female (F) fetal brain at gestation day (d) 45, 60 and 90. The analysis showed fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brain of male and female fetuses in earlier gestation (d45-d60) when compared to late gestation (d60-d90). The homeobox (HOX) A5 gene that regulates pattern formation in early development was in the top upregulated DEGs between d45 to d60 in fetuses of both sexes. This study also found HOX B5 and D3 genes were in the top upregulated genes between d45 and d60 of the fetal brain of females, but not males. The second experiment (Chapter 3) investigated DNA methylation in pigs. DNA methylation in the fetal brain of both sexes at the same three gestation days was performed by enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq). Hotspots of methylation in specific chromosomal regions were observed in the analysis. The analysis identified 1,475 sites in the pig genome that were methylated in the fetal brain, irrespective of sex, during development. The same sites were methylated in a canonically correlated manner in the blood of the adult stage, both in sows and boars. This is consistent with the Dilman theory of developmental aging (DevAge), which suggests that aging and early development of the brain are regulated by common molecular processes. A comparative analysis (Chapter 4) compared the gene expression patterns in the fetal brain and placenta between pigs and mice. The analysis identified 112 genes that were expressed (mean FPKM &gt; 10) in the fetal brain of both species but not expressed (mean FPKM &lt; 1) in the placenta of either species, and 10 genes that were expressed in the placenta of both species but not expressed in the fetal brain. In-silico analysis of the transcription factor binding sites in the 500 bp of the upstream DNA of these common genes revealed that they were commonly regulated by the RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which is a multifaceted transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of neurogenesis as well as controls neural excitation and the aging processes.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Animal Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88112</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88112</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Connor</given_name>\\n      <surname>Voss</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Heiman</given_name>\\n      <surname> Suzette</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Applying T.G.

Page&apos;s scale for measuring base crisis response. After applying the scale to seven crises that occurred at MU during the timeframe, several opportunities are identified for strengthening the reliability of the scale in evaluating a wider variety of crises. These include incorporating speed of base crisis response into the scale, more specifically defining the target audiences that should be considered when applying the scale, and the possibility of creating different objectives for crises in which continuity information is more applicable than safety information in the organization&apos;s base crisis response.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Journalism</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.A.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88113</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88113</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Olivia M.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Warner</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>McCarthy</given_name>\\n      <surname> Denis</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>The impact of gender and traditional norm adherence on event-level alcohol outcomes</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Men consume more alcohol than women, both globally and within the United States specifically, experience different patterns of social problems from drinking, and differ in their risk for developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). Research has explored whether these differences are attributable to a number of factors that differ between men and women, including biological differences, personality traits, mood, and drinking motives. Multiple studies (McCreary et al., 1999; Neve et al., 1997) have demonstrated that traditional gender norms may partially account for gender differences in drinking - with adherence to traditional masculine norms associated with increased alcohol consumption among men, and traditional feminine norms associated with lower consumption among women. The current study used an ecological momentary assessment (EMA; Shiffman, 2009) design to test an event-level model by which gender norms may influence drinking and alcohol-related problems. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that gender nms moderated both momentary mood and drinking motives.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Psychology</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.A.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88114</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88114</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Lindsey Grace</given_name>\\n      <surname>Wichman</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Meyer</given_name>\\n      <surname> Allison M.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Factors affecting neonatal beef calf metabolism and vigor</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Two studies were conducted to investigate factors affecting neonatal beef calf metabolism and vigor. In the first study, effects of late gestational nutrient restriction on colostrum yield, neonatal vigor, and blood chemistry and hematology measures were investigated in beef cattle. Colostrum volume and weight from nutrient restricted dams was 40 percent less compared with control dams. Although gestational nutrition did not affect gestation length or calf birth weight, calves born to control dams had faster times to attempt to stand and to stand. Calves born to nutrient restricted dams had greater serum protein metabolites from 6 to 48 h of age. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase concentrations were greater in nutrient restricted calves until 24 h postnatal. Red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were greater in control calves at 6 and 12 h of age. In conclusion, calves born to nutrient restricted dams experienced more trauma at birth, reduced neonatal vigor, and had less colostrum available but greater serum protein concentrations. The objectives of the second study were to determine the effect of calving season on perinatal nutrient availability and neonatal vigor. Fall-born calves tended to have lighter birth weight and faster time to stand than spring-born calves. Spring-born calves had greater circulating 0 h glucose, 0 and 6 h NEFA, and 0, 6, 12, and 48 h triglycerides. Fall-born calves had greater sodium and magnesium during the first 48 h postnatal. Spring-born calves had greater aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase concentrations until 48 h of age. Albumin, chloride, calcium, and anion gap were greater in fall-born calves. Bicarbonate and direct bilirubin were greater in spring-born calves. In conclusion, spring-born calves are heavier at birth but were slower to stand. Additionally, differences in metabolites over time suggest that spring- and fall-born calves adapt to postnatal life differently where thermoregulation plays an important role.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Animal Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88115</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88115</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> No-Ya</given_name>\\n      <surname>Yu</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Segovia</given_name>\\n      <surname> Michelle</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Nudging meat eaters towards plant-based meat alternatives : an online supermarket experiment</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">We implement a non-hypothetical online grocery shopping experiment to study the impact of health and environment related information nudges on consumers&apos; purchases of meat and plant-based meat alternatives. More specifically, we exogenously manipulate an information message to appear next to meat and plantbased meat products while subjects make purchasing decisions. Subjects receive one of four treatments at random: 1) Health treatment, which displays information about the health benefits of eating less meat; 2) Environment treatment, which presents a message related to the environmental impact of reducing meat consumption; 3) Combined treatment, which displays a message that combines the information from the health and environment messages; and 4) Control, where no information is provided. Moreover, we elicit subjects&apos; implicit association between healthiness and environmental impact of meat and plant-based meat using two implicit association tests. We find the environmental message to be an effective instrument for motivating meat eaters to purchase plant-based meat products. We also find that, on average, meat eaters in our sample implicitly perceive meat to be healthier but environmentally unsustainable compared to plant-based meat products. Furthermore, using a latent class analysis (LCA), we identify three distinct latent classes based on subjects&apos; preferences for purchasing meat products and their plant-based meat purchases frequency. Members in Class 1 are driven by the taste and price of meat products, whereas Class 2 expresses high attention for health and environmental impact attributes and Class 3 is open to reduce their meat consumption. The LCA indicates heterogeneity of preferences across meat eaters, suggesting future interventions can target to specific consumer segments, instead of focus on general meat eaters. Overall, our findings provide implications for policy makers and food marketers as to whether meat eaters can be steered toward purchasing plant-based meat under different behavioral nudges.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Agricultural and Applied Economics</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>M.S.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88116</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88116</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Jennah</given_name>\\n      <surname>Strathausen</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Sanchez</given_name>\\n      <surname> Francisco J.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>The influence of role models on trans men\\'s identity development</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face significant stigma and discrimination stemming from negative societal attitudes toward their experienced gender incongruence. Much of the LGBTQ literature on TGNC health disparities and gender minority stress focuses on the influence of overt acts of violence and oppression, often leaving more subtle and ubiquitous stressors, like invisibility, unexplored. In addition, there is a limited amount of literature on the experiences of transgender men, particularly those residing in the central U.S. Research suggests that the influence of positive role models can mitigate many of the stressors experienced by TGNC people. This study aimed to explore the influence of role models on trans men&apos;s identity development. Using Photovoice Methodology situated in Community-Based Participatory Research, this project collaboratively explored the needs, assets, and concerns of trans men living in Mid-Missouri. Twelve participants (MdnAge = 31.5 years-old) and the researchers separately grouped the participant-generated photographs and personal narratives into eight themes, including Authenticity, Acceptance, Inaccessibility, Isolation, and &quot;Trans Enough?&quot; Results supported the idea that access to positive role models serves as a protective factor for TGNC people. Results additionally highlight that trans men possess significant characteristics of resilience.

Research shows a positive relationship exists between the educational attainment of older youth in foster care and the presence of supportive adults in their lives (Clemens, Helm, Myers, Thomas &amp; Tis, 2017; Dworsky &amp; Perez, 2010; Neal, 2017). This study will explore foster parents as supportive adults, specifically, educational advocates. Educational advocacy comes from the field of special education and refers to behaviors of supportive adults who intervene and mediate for a child or someone who cannot advocate for self. This study will expand educational advocacy research (Duquette, Fullarton, Orders, &amp; Robertson-Grewal, 2011; Duquette, Orders, Fullarton, &amp; Robertson-Grewal, 2011; Duquette, Stodel, Fullarton, &amp; Hagglund, 2011; Mulick &amp; Butter, 2002; Olivos, Jimenez-Castellanos, &amp; Ochoa, 2011; Wilson Cooper, 2007) to foster parents. Framing the study will be the four dimensions of advocacy proposed by Duquette, Stodel, Fullarton, and Hagglund (2011). The framework will inform the interview protocol: items will follow the four dimensions (awareness, seeking information, presenting the case, and monitoring) to explore how foster parents tacitly advocate for the educational needs of their foster children. This qualitative study will seek to answer the research questions How do foster parents serve as educational advocates for foster children? and What challenges do foster parents face as they serve as educational advocates? The study will use a qualitative research design with a phenomenological approach. Data collection will include in-depth interviews of eight to ten foster parents. By extending educational advocacy research to foster parents, this study will highlight the need for foster youth to have educational advocates and the ways in which that need is, or is not, being met. This study will provide a research foundation for additional research, with the hope of helping to ensure an educational advocate, foster parent or otherwise, is engaged in advocacy behaviors for every foster child in Missouri.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Educational Leadership and Policy/Educational Leadership-Distance</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ed.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88052</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88052</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Daryl</given_name>\\n      <surname>Traylor</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Enriquez</given_name>\\n      <surname> Maithe</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Primary care provider prep prescribing practices : southern United States</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The Southern United States (U.S.) accounts for more than half of new HIV cases annually and African Americans make up the majority of new HIV diagnoses in this region. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective biomedical HIV prevention strategy that is underutilized. Few studies have examined the PrEP prescribing practices of primary care providers (PCPs), particularly in the Southern U.S. This cross-sectional survey, driven by the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), examined the prescribing practices of Southern U.S. PCPs. Relationships between PCPs personal and practice variables were examined, together with TTM decisional balance variables. Participants (n=223) who had more African American patients in their practice were more likely to be in a higher TTM stage of change (p = .002) and were more likely to have written a PrEP prescription (p = .001). Access to PrEP resources (OR = 1.85, p = .001), streamlined insurance prior authorization processes (OR = 1.52, p = .010), working with staff who have PrEP knowledge (OR = 1.51, p = .033), having PrEP training (OR = 40.26, p &lt; .001) and having patients who are motivated to take PrEP (OR = 2.19, p = .007) were significant facilitators to PrEP prescribing. Significant barriers to PrEP prescribing included a lack of provider PrEP training (OR = 0.43, p = .003), lack of clinical leadership regarding PrEP (OR = 0.65, p = .018), lack of insurance (OR = 2.74, p = .002), and likelihood of low patient adherence to PrEP (OR = 0.53, p = .001). Findings indicate that this sample of PCPs were more likely to be at a higher TTM stage of change and have written a PrEP prescription if they saw more African American patients in their practice. Further, significant facilitators of PrEP prescribing included access to PrEP resources, streamlined insurance prior authorization processes, working with staff who have PrEP knowledge, having PrEP training, and having patients who are motivated to take PrEP. Significant barriers to PrEP prescribing included a lack of PrEP training, a lack of clinical leadership regarding PrEP, patient lack of insurance, and likelihood of low patient adherence. This study contributes to the body of knowledge regarding PCP PrEP prescribing practices. Findings from this study may inform future interventions that aim to enhance PrEP prescribing among primary care providers who serve Southern African American individuals at risk for acquisition of HIV disease.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Nursing/Distance Mediated Option</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88053</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88053</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Douglas</given_name>\\n      <surname>Valentine</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Prasad</given_name>\\n      <surname> Srirupa</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Ars moriendi as social reality : articulation of the good death in the United States</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Death and dying are often theorized as micro-level processes, focusing on the experience of the death process from the perspective of the dying, or in the context of grief and psychological healing on the part of the bereaved. While these academic analyses have merit, their analytic utility is limited. Death, dying, bereavement, and memorial are social processes that require multidisciplinary investigation. Utilizing sociological, religious studies, and ritual studies methodologies, this dissertation explores ars moriendi, or the good death, as a process enmeshed within the macro-structural forces of political, religious, economic, and social institutions. Through these discrete case studies, the dying and the bereaved are recentered as active agents driving and responding to change within the contemporary American death industry.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Sociology</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88054</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88054</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Mary Elaine</given_name>\\n      <surname>Vansant</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Crespy</given_name>\\n      <surname> David</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Intercultural adapturgy : twenty-first century women adapting Spanish golden age plays</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Transferring work from one culture to another through translation or adaptation is a delicate process which requires careful consideration of both the positionality of the adapter and the intertextual reaction of the adapted work&apos;s target audience. In addition to traditional adaptation theories like intertextuality, the theatrical field of dramaturgy offers helpful insight into the adaptation process, especially as it relates to plays. This dissertation examines the ways that the combination of adaptation studies and dramaturgy, which Jane Barnette calls adapturgy, can inform intercultural adaptaitons of dramatic literature to create performable and effective theatre experiences for twenty-first century audiences. I achieve this goal by first examining two adapted plays: A Little Betrayal Among Friends by Caridad Svich, adapted from La traicion en la amistad by Maria de Zayas y Sotomayor, and Fever/Dream by Sheila Callaghan, adapted from La vida es sueno by Pedro Calderon de la Barca. I look at how dramaturgical and adapation theories can be applied to these plays via script analysis and contextual questioning. Then, using the skills gleaned from those two examples, I create my own translation and adaptation of Los empenos de una casa by Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, and I reflect on my adapturgical process of doing so. In creating both a translation, titled How to Build a Noble House, and an adaptation, titled With the Temptation, a Way of Escape, I both preserve the unique traits of the Spanish Golden Age for performance in the twenty-first century and amplify Sor Juana&apos;s comedic and social intentions for a contemporary society. I believe that both of these considerations, alongside a reflection on the adapter&apos;s positionality and the intentions of the producing organization and production team for a live production, are invaluable to both the field of adaptaiton studies and of dramaturgy.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Theatre</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88055</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88055</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Derek</given_name>\\n      <surname>Ward</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Hutchinson</given_name>\\n      <surname> Sandy</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Mentoring in Missouri schools : how mentoring fosters professional and personal growth</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The first five years of an educator&apos;s career are the most important time in determining if they will stay in the education profession. With the stress of starting a new career, novice teachers are often asked to do the most work. To help them navigate through the first few years of teaching and to increase retention, Missouri has adopted a mentoring policy. This narrative study describes mentee and mentor perception of the mentoring program and how they feel it affects their professional and personal lives. This study opens the doors to show what mentees and mentors feel is beneficial about the mentoring program and what is needed to make it better.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Educational Leadership and Policy/Educational Leadership-Distance</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ed.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88056</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88056</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Patricka</given_name>\\n      <surname>Williams-Simon</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>King</given_name>\\n      <surname> Elizabeth G.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Dissecting the genetic basis of learning, memory, and thermal tolerance in a multi-parental population of fruit flies</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Learning, memory, and thermal tolerance are complex traits that are fundamental survival skills in many species. For example, small poikilotherms &quot; like Drosophila melanogaster, have evolved physiological mechanisms to learn from and adapt to rapidly warming temperatures because their body temperature reflects that of their surroundings. Along with physiological mechanisms, these animals have also adapted cognitive practices, such as learning and memory, which help them escape extreme temperatures. Although scientific evidence shows that learning, memory, and thermal tolerance have been subjected to natural selection as a means of adapting to warmer temperatures, studies examining both traits (i.e., learning, and thermal tolerance) and how they relate genetically have not been done. Investigating the natural variation of the genes that control these traits is essential if we want to understand better how these traits arise within species. With recent advances in genomic technology, it is now feasible apart - down to a single gene - regions of the genome that influence complex phenotypes. For my Ph.D., I took a quantitative genetics and genomics approach to dissect the genetic basis of learning, memory, and thermal tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster. I hypothesized that there will be a shared and independent genetic locus controlling learning and memory and that there will be a trade-off between learning and thermal tolerance. To genetically dissect learning and memory performance, I used the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR), a multiparent mapping resource, consisting of a large set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs), which allows for high-resolution genome-wide scans, and the identification of loci contributing to naturally occurring genetic variation. Using a highly sensitive apparatus known as the &quot;heat box&quot;, I trained flies with temperatures (24 [degrees] C and 41 [degrees] C, which is aversive) to learn to remain on one side of a chamber (place learning) and to remember thiory). An indl that spent most of the time on the side of the chamber associated with 24 [degrees] C will be considered to have high learning and memory. Immediately after, I assayed the flies for thermal tolerance, which is measured as the time to incapacitation at a constant high 41 [degrees] C temperature for 9.5 mins. I identified 16 different loci across the genome that significantly affect place learning and or memory performance, with 5 of these loci affecting both traits and eight loci that influence thermal tolerance. To identify transcriptomic differences associated with learning, memory, and thermal tolerance, I performed RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) on pooled samples of seven high-performing and seven low-performing RILs for all three traits and identified hundreds of genes with differences in expression. Integrating our transcriptomic results with the mapping results allowed us to identify nine promising candidate genes that control learning and twenty-one genes that fall between the most significant QTL that is possibly influenci thermal tolerance. I then used a few different methods to identify and validate genetic variants from the list of candidate genes within the most significant QTL (Q6) that influences thermal tolerance. First, I performed a structural variance analysis and found a few structural variants (SV; eg: inserts, deletions, or P-elements) located within candidate genes. Genes that contain SVs are known to influence phenotypic variation, and thus identifying any SV within candidate genes will provide a greater understanding of the genetic basis of a specific complex trait. Second, I functionally validated the candidate genes to identify causal genes using the UAS-GAL4/RNAi system. In this classical genetic system, a specific gene is disrupted through mutagenesis, which allows for the investigation of that gene on a specific phenotype. I then phenotyped lines to determine the phenotypic effect of each gene on thermal tolerance. We screened 20 UAS-RNAi lines (&#126;1900 individuals) that were crossed with both pan neuronal and ubiquitously expressed Gal4 promoters and found 3 lines that were significant. Collectively, these results suggest that learning, memory, and thermal tolerance are highly polygenic and that multiple genes with both large and small effects influence these traits. Future work will aim to validate the function of candidate genes that influence learning and memory and identify the molecular pathways that the causal genes that influence thermal tolerance are associated with.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Biological Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88057</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88057</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> G.

I aimed to garner an authentic picture and capture the essence of what it means to be a successful urban elementary music educator. This hermeneutic phenomenology was guided by two research questions: (1) What are the lived experiences of urban music educators who have been successful in teaching music at the elementary level? (2) What are the pedagogical approaches used by elementary music educators in urban contexts? The related sub-questions were as follows: (1) What characterizes success in the urban elementary music classroom? (2) What are characteristics of these educators (e.g., personal, educational, interpersonal)? Data collection included approximately 60-minute semi-structured interviews from eight participants. A constant comparative method was utilized to examine the coded transcripts. Trustworthiness was established through data triangulation, participant checking, and peer checking. Through the three-part analysis, six themes emerged: (a) relationships are key; (b) understanding how music functions for students; (c) willingness to perform unofficial job duties; (d) concerns about urban teacher preparation; (e) curricular and pedagogical decisions; and (f) urban music teacher characteristics. The findings of this study, as well as that of other scholars in music education, suggest that being a successful urban elementary music educator is the result of a composite set of skills. The teachers who participated in this study use creativity when making curricular and pedagogical decisions, possess a complex knowledge and understanding of their students, their students&apos; families, and their students&apos; community, and have a deep affection for what they do and whom they serve. Successful urban elementary music educators can serve as valuable resources to provide understanding and offer suggestions for improving urban music education, including ways to nurture and develop the next wave of music educators.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Music/Music Education</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88058</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88058</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Seth</given_name>\\n      <surname>Woods</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Sebastian</given_name>\\n      <surname> James</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>The relationship between teacher stress and job satisfaction as moderated by coping using single-item measures</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Teacher stress has been studied for decades and the negative outcomes of too much stress are well known, such as burnout and lack of teacher retention. The present study focuses on the relationship between teacher stress and teacher job satisfaction. The Transactional Model of stress specifies that coping must be accounted for when considering a person&apos;s stress reaction, as a person&apos;s coping capacity or resources are what determines whether stress reaction will occur. The present study seeks to answer the question: Does coping moderate the relationship between teacher stress and job satisfaction? Moderation analysis was conducted using data from randomized trials examining a leadership training program. The results showed that coping moderated the relationship between stress and job satisfaction. Adding to the importance of this study for practitioners is that all three constructs (stress, coping, and job satisfaction) were measured using single items, making it easy for practitioners to measure among their staff.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Educational Leadership and Policy/Educational Leadership-Distance</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ed.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88059</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88059</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Jesse W.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Wyatt</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Gates</given_name>\\n      <surname> Kent S.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Structural and kinetic studies of human aldh7a1 and aldh9a1</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The regulation and detoxification of endogenously and exogenously derived aldehydes is paramount to cellular survival due to the highly reactive nature of aldehydes as electrophiles. Human aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are a superfamily of oxidoreductase enzymes that have critical roles in this regulation and detoxification. Misregulation of ALDH gene expression or mutations in the genes encoding for ALDHs lead to numerous disease pathologies. While extensive work has been conducted in understanding the metabolic roles and structures of these enzymes, there remains a need to further expand the structural and kinetic understanding of members of the human ALDH superfamily. This thesis aims to utilize the tools of structural biology and enzymology to expand the understanding of the ALDH superfamily.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Chemistry</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88060</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88060</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Zhangwei (Alex)</given_name>\\n      <surname>Yang</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Scott</given_name>\\n      <surname> Grant</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Deep heterogeneous superpixel neural networks for image analysis and feature extraction</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Lately, deep convolutional neural networks are rapidly transforming and enhancing computer vision accuracy and performance, and pursuing higher-level and interpretable object recognition. Superpixel-based methodologies have been used in conventional computer vision research where their efficient representation has superior effects. In contemporary computer vision research driven by deep neural networks, superpixel-based approaches mainly rely on oversegmentation to provide a more efficient representation of the imagery data, especially when the computation is too expensive in time or memory to perform in pairwise similarity regularization or complex graphical probabilistic inference. In this dissertation, we proposed a novel superpixel-enabled deep neural network paradigm by relaxing some of the prior assumptions in the conventional superpixel-based methodologies and exploring its capabilities in the context of advanced deep convolutional neural networks. This produces novel neural network architectures that can achieve higher-level object relation modeling, weakly supervised segmentation, high explainability, and facilitate insightful visualizations. This approach has the advantage of being an efficient representation of the visual signal and has the capability to dissect out relevant object components from other background noise by spatially re-organizing visual features. Specifically, we have created superpixel models that join graphical neural network techniques and multiple-instance learning to achieve weakly supervised object detection and generate precise object bounding without pixel-level training labels. This dissection and the subsequent learning by the architecture promotes explainable models, whereby the human users of the models can see the parts of the objects that have led to recognition. Most importantly, this neural design&apos;s natural result goes beyond abstract rectangular bounds of an object occurrence (e.g., bounding box or image chip), but instead approaches efficient parts-based segmented recognition. It has been tested on commercial remote sensing satellite imagery and achieved success. Additionally, We have developed highly efficient monocular indoor depth estimation based on superpixel feature extraction. Furthermore, we have demonstrated state-of-theart weakly supervised object detection performance on two contemporary benchmark data sets, MS-COCO and VOC 2012. In the future, deep learning techniques based on superpixel-enabled image analysis can be further optimized in accuracy and computational performance; and it will also be interesting to evaluate in other research domains, such as those involving medical imagery, infrared imagery, or hyperspectral imagery.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Computer Science</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88061</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88061</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Colleen Brennan</given_name>\\n      <surname>Young</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Cowgill</given_name>\\n      <surname> Libby</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Body size and shape in insular environments and applications of the island rule in biological anthropology</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The discovery of small-bodied hominin fossils in 2004 on the island of Flores, Indonesia, unearthed a large debate within biological anthropology. This debate has exemplified that there are questions and research areas that biological anthropologists do not understand about island evolution. To improve understanding on the causes and products of evolution within island areas for biological anthropologists, this dissertation addresses three overarching research areas relevant to the biological anthropology community. The first is an analysis of how primate body sizes vary on islands, with interpretations that are anchored in the evolutionary history of body sizes of primates. Primates that initially evolved body sizes to survive within a frugivorous niche, with elongated life spans to improve survival in unpredictable environments, have body sizes distributed among islands in relation to the presence of absence of these pressures. Smaller islands contain more large, bodied primates overall, whereas larger islands contain more small-bodied ones. Second, an analysis of island fox body size and shape indicates that island foxes have reduced body sizes and divergent skeletal traits compared to mainland, closely related counterparts. Distinct body proportions are likely due to selection because allometric scaling of limb lengths to body mass are divergent for the island fox. Further, the island fox is not a scaled down version of the mainland fox, with limbs decreasing in size at a faster rate compared to the mainland. Last, an investigation on the diversity of two human populations in the Baja California peninsula demonstrates that Amerindians who migrated to and survived in these regions were impacted by ecogeographic pressures in different degrees, likely related to access to resources. Heat-adapted skeletal traits are apparent in both human populations who inhabited this hot desert, but body size is distinct for the two groups. Body size is smaller for individuals with less access to marine resources and increased susceptibility to periods of drought and starvation. Body size is larger for humans with convenient access to oceanic and terrestrial resources. These studies demonstrate that primates, omnivores, and humans are not immune to the effects of insularity as has been suggested. Rather, interpreting body size and shape alterations requires contextualizing the organism with their evolutionary histories and subsequent interactions within the island areas. Body size alterations are the result of shifting selective pressures from competing with other community members to competing with other individuals within a population over finite resources. As such, body shape can also be divergent compared to closely related mainland counterparts due to adaptation to local ecogeographic pressures. Skeletal traits of organisms need to be interpreted in relation to their migratory journeys and adaptation to local ecogeographic pressures within the island. For humans, contextualizing these variables with cultural and behavioral characteristics is imperative to understand a body size response within a sociocultural omnivorous niche.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Anthropology</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88062</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88062</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Colleen L.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Eddy</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Herman</given_name>\\n      <surname> Keith C.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Evaluation of a bibliotherapy-based stress management training for teachers</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The study was a randomized control trial of a cognitive-behavioral bibliotherapy-based stress management training for teachers. The intervention consisted of the Stress Management for Teachers book, an in-person meeting, and three brief follow-up webinars with weekly practice over the course of 4 weeks. There were 53 participants in the study and teachers were randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist control conditions. Multilevel regression was used to examine the intervention effects accounting for teachers nested in schools and controlling for school district, years of teaching experience, and the baseline measure. The intervention reduced stress on the Perceived Stress Scale (? = -0.53). Teachers also increased in specific coping strategies of planning (? = 0.62), positive reframing (? = 0.66), and decreased in self-reported substance use (? = -0.44). The intervention did not have statistically significant effects on contextual factors or on observed classroom behaviors. The intervention demonstrated treatment effects on anxiety symptoms on the GAD-7 (? = -0.51). Further, in comparison to participants in the control group, teachers in intervention condition had statistically significant changes in symptom severity level in anxiety on the GAD-7 (Cramer&apos;s V = .45) and in depression on the PHQ-8 (Cramer&apos;s V = .42). From progress monitoring data, teachers in the intervention condition had greater rates of improvement in increased coping, confidence and use of coping strategies (p&apos;s &lt; .05). Additional supports may be needed to enhance coping with stressors related to classroom management and organizational health and to optimize the intervention delivery.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Ed, School and Counseling Psychology/Counseling Psych</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88117</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88117</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Jason</given_name>\\n      <surname>Edwards</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Rottinghaus</given_name>\\n      <surname> Patrick</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>An exploration of black college men\\'s perspective on their career outlook through cluster analysis</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Black men currently significantly lag other groups in their participation in high status occupations. There have been several studies to highlight the challenges of Black people in the workplace but there is a lack of research that assess how college men think about their career futures (Barrett, 2004; Byars-Winston, 2010; Hoffman, Llagas, &amp; Snyder, 2003). The current study aims to explore what Black college men believe about their career potential postgraduation during a critical time in the development of their careers. The constructs career adaptability, career decision self-efficacy, career optimism, and the impostor phenomenon will be used to identify strengths and internal barriers that both positively and negatively influence the psychology of Black men in relation to their career motivations, aspirations, and their confidence in their ability to successfully navigate the career landscape. Cluster analysis was used to identify groups of participants based upon the constructs measured and demographic variables. A six-cluster solution was identified in the sample that represented distinct profiles of career readiness. The clusters were labeled &apos;Impostor with low optimism and career agency&apos;, &apos;Highly prepared impostor&apos;, &apos;Comfortable&apos;, &apos;Not prepared&apos;, &apos;Very comfortable and highly prepared&apos;, &apos;Impostor&apos;. Black Racial Identity measures suggest that positive esteem held for Black people corelates with high career preparedness and lower distress. The results from this study provides information useful for vocational practioners and university administrators who support the career development needs of Black college men.

Subsequently, programming specific to this issue has been developed to intervene; however, there is very little research that has captured the impact of such initiatives. The current study employed a mixed methods approach to evaluate the effect a Black men&apos;s initiative has on the academic performance, retention, racial identity, sense of belonging, college self-efficacy, and career decision making self-efficacy of Black male college students. Quantitative results for the initiative were inconclusive; however, qualitative interviews reveal that students in the BMI experience different levels of access and identity development than their peers not enrolled in the program.

Anglers vie for the opportunity to catch Smallmouth Bass recreationally and competitively, spending billions of dollars every year on travel, equipment, and conservation permits. Along with their extreme popularity, they are of central importance in their native ecosystems throughout central and eastern North America. They are voracious apex predators, controlling top-down food web dynamics among fishes and invertebrates in both streams and natural lakes, and they act as obligate hosts in the life cycles of several freshwater mussels. A great deal is known about the general ecology of Smallmouth Bass and their role in aquatic communities across their extensive native distribution. Much less is known about levels and distribution of diversity within the species. In 1940, Carl Hubbs and Reeve Bailey published descriptions of two distinct subspecies: the Northern Smallmouth Bass (M. d. dolomieu), inhabiting the central and eastern portion of the range, and the Neosho Smallmouth Bass (M. d. velox), which is range-restricted to the Arkansas River Basin in the Central Interior Highlands. While the subspecies classification was largely accepted among taxonomists, it was predicated on only a few subtle morphological traits, including differences in coloration, body size, and the presence of glossohyal teeth. Researchers began to investigate genetic divergence among Smallmouth Bass populations at the end of the twentieth century. Some genetic structure has been detected, but the overall diversity and the evolutionary forces generating contemporary patterns have been considered extremely complex and therefore unresolved, especially where the Neosho and Northern subspecies ranges meet in the Central Interior Highlands. To address the need for a robust understanding of the divergence and evolution history of Smallmouth Bass in the Central Interior Highlands, I addressed three broad areas concerning the phylogeography and conservation of the species using a combination of morphological, genetic, and genomic data: 1) patterns of genetic and morphological differentiation between the Neosho and Northern Smallmouth Bass subspecies, 2) lineage diversification and the extent and origins of admixture within the subspecies, and 3) effects of admixture on individual growth and fitness in two streams within the Neosho Smallmouth Bass native range. Using neutral microsatellite markers and a combination of three independent Bayesian analysis methods, I detected complex and hierarchical population structure of Smallmouth Bass in the Central Interior Highlands. The broadest level of structure indicated two distinct genetic clusters corresponding to the Neosho and Northern subspecies, but with substantial and heterogenous patterns of admixture within some streams in the Neosho native range. At finer levels of structure, clusters corresponded to river drainages and to potentially distinct populations within drainages. The Northern and Neosho subspecies were morphologically distinct overall based on principal component analysis of five morphometric traits, but they significantly differed only in head length. Based on genome-wide variation at over 50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, the Neosho and Northern subspecies represented two diverged, monophyletic clades, each comprising two additional monophyletic lineages. Populations in Big Piney Creek and the Illinois Bayou within the Neosho range also showed signatures of local adaptation based on outlier FST analysis. Admixture in the Illinois River system within the Neosho range originated from a hatchery strain of Northern Smallmouth Bass found in Skiatook Lake, Oklahoma, while admixture in the Elk River, upper Arkansas River tributaries, and the Illinois Bayou and Big Piney Creek system originated from the White River in the Northern range. Demographic analysis revealed that admixture in these streams has occurred on different time scales, in some cases likely due to historic migration, and in other cases likely due to secondary contact, possibly as a result of anthropogenic introductions. In Big Sugar Creek and the Elk River, two Neosho Smallmouth Bass native streams known to be admixed with White River Northern Smallmouth Bass, individual growth did not differ between genetically pure Neosho, pure Northern, or admixed fish. However, in the Elk River alone, average length-at-infinity (maximum length) was lower for admixed fish than for either pure Neosho or pure Northern fish. We also found a significant negative relationship between multi-locus heterozygosity (based on fourteen microsatellite loci) and body condition, suggesting that increased intermixing may be causing outbreeding depression in these streams. The Neosho and Northern Smallmouth Bass constitute highly differentiated, locally adapted, and independently evolving lineages in the Central Interior Highlands. Despite divergence, there are also complex and extensive patterns of admixture in the Neosho range which may be contributing to lower fitness in two Neosho Smallmouth Bass streams. It will be crucial to consider these patterns and their potential outcomes in the development of management protocols for the preservation of endemic diversity within this economically and ecologically vital sportfish.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Biological Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88120</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88120</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Lauren A.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Hermann</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Unrath</given_name>\\n      <surname> Kathy</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Reclaiming relations : embodied practices of visual arts educators knowing, being and doing evaluation</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The articles in this work address histories of how visual art educators have come to exist within scholarship on teacher evaluation. This study, reconceptualized outside of methodology through a post qualitative framework of inquiry, embodies poststructural feminist theories of ethics, exemplifying living theory and process as &apos;lifework&apos;. (Re)situating the evaluative experiences of art educators through their own visual stories grounded in feminist ethics where research acts as sacred practice invites an exploration of more relational ways of being as teachers, leaders, makers, and researchers. In turn, this research seeks to open spaces where we ask what becomes possible in evaluative practice when we look to the arts as a model. Opportunities emerge as the resistances of art educators reverberate beyond current systemic boundaries and offer a possibility to think differently about evaluation. Utilizing the practices of quilting, the work charts a new coursnowledge and think and perform research and teacher evaluation differently as a practice of mending, challenging (mis)representations, building relational trust through power shifts and receptive listening, and constructing a true capacity for connectedness.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Learning, Teaching and Curriculum/Art Education</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88121</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88121</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Stephanie Hernandez</given_name>\\n      <surname>Hernandez</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Hart</given_name>\\n      <surname> Jeni</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Resisting intersectional marginality by developing a mestiza consciousness : undergraduate women of color challenging and shaping power</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This critical qualitative study explores how power shapes the experiences of undergraduate Women of Color engaged in activism and advocacy on social justice issues at the University of Missouri. The development and design of this study is grounded in a Critical Race Feminist (CRF) epistemology. The research questions were: 1) How does power shape the experiences of undergraduate Women of Color engaged in activism and advocacy at the University of Missouri? 2) How do Women of Color experience exclusion in their activist/advocacy work and/or spaces on campus? 3) What strategies do Women of Color employ to resist marginalization on campus &quot; in and outside of activist work? The research focused on the experiences of five Women of Color undergraduate students at the University of Missouri, four of whom were in their fourth year at the institution and one of whom was a junior. More specifically, there was one Black woman, a Chicana, a mixed-race Mexicana who is also White, and two South Asian Indian women. the use of testimonios, plnticas, and sista circles, participants shared their stories and experiences. The identification of these frames and methods is partly a result of my own position as a Boricua, Woman of Color, who seeks to conduct research in a way that is liberatory and reciprocal for participants. The findings of this research were interpreted using intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1991; Collins, 2019) and Mestiza consciousness (Anzaldna, 1997). I found four over-arching themes: Engaging and Adjusting Behavior, Culture of Exploitation, Distrust Confirmed and Cultivated, and Developing a Mestiza Consciousness. Overall findings demonstrate how participants activism largely came in the form of creating awareness for others, predominantly White people. In addition, findings showed how those with privilege and power regulate participants&apos; emotions; a lack of intersectional praxis and analysis in all areas of campus life, including equity and diversity work; a performative diversity culture that haed in equity and justice; dominant representation reflecting political investments; and how the development of a Mestiza consciousness is used by participants to challenge intersectional marginalization. Finally, this study demonstrates how participants&apos; consciousness and activist work are continuously evolving and how they work to meet their needs and find reciprocity in their activist and advocacy efforts.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Educational Leadership and Policy/Higher Education</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88122</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88122</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Yuexu</given_name>\\n      <surname>Jiang</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Xu</given_name>\\n      <surname> Dong</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>An interpretable protein localization prediction framework</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Protein localization is related to many human diseases. Therefore, the prediction of protein localization is an essential task that has been extensively studied. Additionally, the study of the localization mechanism can provide more biological insights and testable hypotheses. In this thesis, we propose MULocDeep, a general deep learning-based localization prediction framework. We designed a matrix layer in its architecture to reflect the hierarchical relationships of localization in cells. This enables MULocDeep, to predict multiple localizations of a protein at both subcellular and suborganellar levels. We collected a dataset with 44 suborganellar localization annotations in 10 major subcellular compartments--the most comprehensive suborganelle localization dataset to date. Our collaborators also experimentally generated an independent dataset of mitochondrial proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures, Solanum tuberosum tubers, and Vicia faba roots and made this dataset publicl using the above datasets show that overall, MULocDeep outperforms other major methods at both subcellular and suborganellar levels. We also applied Long short-term memory (LSTM) and the multi-head self-attention in MULocDeep to pursue a single amino acid level resolution when assessing their contributions to localization. This provides insights into the mechanism of protein sorting and localization motifs. Many of the candidate sites or motifs match the existing localization knowledge.

As conceptual metaphor theory demonstrates, metaphors shape attitudes and behaviors toward the concept they are used to understand. It is then perhaps unsurprising that war metaphors for policing have become more common alongside the militarization of police. Still, no research has examined the link between police use of war metaphors and acquisition of military equipment. Using ecological and social media data, the study began to examine this link. Specifically, 241,084 social media posts from police departments (N = 80) were coded for the presence of war metaphors, which were then used to predict the amount of military equipment acquired through the federal 1033 Program. Building from conceptual metaphor theory, it was hypothesized that police use of war metaphors would be positively associated with their department acquisition of militarized equipment. The results did not support this hypothesis; potential reasons for this are considered. Exploratory analysis generated potentially interesting findings regarding police usage of war metaphors following acts of police violence and associations between death-related words and militarized equipment acquisitions.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Psychology/Social-Personality Psychology</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88124</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88124</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Tricia</given_name>\\n      <surname>Joseph</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Mendoza</given_name>\\n      <surname> Pilar</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Journeying from academically-underprepared to prepared : exploring developmental community college students\\' perceptions of developmental advising at a Carribean-based community college</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This study explored how developmental students enrolled at the TTIOO community college experienced the resident developmental advising service. Emphasis was placed on ascertaining how these students perceived the role of developmental advising in enabling them to develop self-regulated behaviors inclusive of goal-setting skills and academic self-efficacy. The study also explored the extent to which this service promoted increased levels of persistence. A qualitative phenomenological case study guided the research process. The data collection methods included phenomenological interviews that were conducted with six student participants; semi-structured interviews that were conducted with two developmental advisors employed at the TTIOO; and documentary analysis. The study&apos;s major limitations include: the majority of the data analysis revolved around the phenomenological interviews; the interviews were facilitated virtually; and the participant selection procesents demonstrating varied levels of academic performance, and both male and female genders. The last limitation is that only one developmental advisor was employed at the time of the study. The findings revealed that the major challenges the participants encountered was the shame and embarrassment of being labelled a developmental student, a sense of being burdensome, difficulty managing course requirements, and personal and financial factors. Secondly, lecturers had a more pronounced effect on the participants&apos; goal setting-competencies and levels of academic self-efficacy. Although the participants were appreciative of the guidance and support provided by their developmental advisor, they believed that the intervention had a minimal impact on their persistence levels.

The concept of successful aging is often utilized by professionals to guide policy and practice for aging populations, yet LGBTQ+ older adults are frequently absent from dominant perspectives on aging. To examine barriers and catalysts for successful aging from a queer perspective, Photovoice--a visual participatory research method--was utilized to engage participants (n = 9) in visually and verbally expressing their lived experience about barriers and catalysts of successful aging and overall aging experiences. The Photovoice exhibit was utilized as an educational tool for key stakeholders including health, legal, social welfare, and business professionals (n = 38). After viewing the virtual exhibit, stakeholders completed an online survey about the potential impact of the exhibit and reactions to the content. DBTQ+ Photovoice participants, two primary themes were identified pertaining to what it means to age successfully as an LGBTQ+ individual: The Relational Landscape and Re-Writing the Narrative. Themes highlighted the centrality of the relationship with oneself, queer identity, and one&apos;s support network. Further, these themes articulated the importance of advocacy and representation as salient to feeling successful in later life. The key stakeholder survey yielded two themes pertaining to the educational impact of the Photovoice exhibit: Images Brought Stories to Light and Nature of Identity. These themes illustrated the ways in which professionals connected emotionally to the stories and images, and their learning about the importance of identity and timing of coming out for LGBTQ+ individuals.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Human Development and Family Science/Human Environmental Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88126</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88126</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Grace Robinson</given_name>\\n      <surname>Kick</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Katz</given_name>\\n      <surname> Martin L.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Disease characterization and pre-clinical testing in canine models of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are inherited lysosomal storage disorders characterized by intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent storage material and by progressive degeneration of neurons in the brain and retina. Clinically, the NCLs are characterized by progressive cognitive and motor impairment, seizures and progressive loss of vision culminating in premature death. Variants in at least 14 genes are known to cause forms of NCL. The CLN2 form of NCL is caused by variants in the TPP1 gene, which encodes the soluble lysosomal hydrolase tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), while the CLN5 form is caused by variants in CLN5, which encodes a lysosomal protein the function of which has not been definitively determined. CLN2 disease has a late-infantile onset and typically culminates in death in the early teenage years. A canine disease model of affected Dachshunds with CLN2 disease recapitulates the features of the human disease and has proven to be an excellent model for preclinical therapy testing. CLN2-affected Dachshunds are homozygous for a single base pair deletion in the canine ortholog of TPP1 which results in a premature termination codon and lack of functional TPP1 protein. Affected dogs present with progressive motor, cognitive and behavioral changes, myoclonic seizures and brain atrophy which progress to end-stage disease requiring humane euthanasia around 10 months of age. Affected dogs also exhibit vison loss associated with progressive retinal degeneration, electroretinogram (ERG) deficits and degeneration of visual centers in the brain. Previous work in the CLN2 Dachshund model demonstrated that delivering functional TPP1 protein to the central nervous system via enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or gene therapy extends lifespan and delays neurological disease progression. However, these treatments did not preserve retinal structure or function. We therefore conducted studies to assess three different methods of delivering functional TPP1 to the retina: (1) intravitreal enzyme replacement therapy, (2) ex vivo cell-mediated gene therapy and (3) in vivo intravitreal gene therapy. Additionally, we tested an ex vivo cell-mediated gene therapy approach to deliver TPP1 to the central nervous system as an alternative to the ERT and gene therapy methods previously assessed in the canine model. Intravitreal ERT was tested both before and after onset of declines in ERG amplitudes. ERT was able to fully preserve ERG b-wave amplitudes when administered pre-symptomatically. Post-symptomatic treatment halted progression of disease-related declines in amplitudes through end stage neurological disease at approximately 10 months of age. The major side effect of treatment was transient intraocular inflammation characterized by anterior and posterior uveitis and by the production of anti-TPP1 antibodies. Treatment also preserved retinal structure, prevented disease-related loss cells in the inner and outer nuclear layers and reduced the accumulation of intracellular storage material in retinal ganglion cells. These results were incorporated into an application that is being submitted to the Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory agencies for approval to conduct a clinical trial of this treatment to prevent progressive vision loss in children with CLN2 disease. A single intravitreal administration of TPP1-overexpressing autologous mesenchymal stem cells (TPP1-MSCs) was able to partially preserve retinal function. ERG rod b-wave amplitudes remained larger in treated eyes than in control eyes through 10 months of age, although amplitudes continued to decline in treated eyes. TPP1-MSCs were safe and well-tolerated and did not cause inflammation. While these results are encouraging, further studies are necessary to optimize this therapy. One-time intravitreal administration of a gene therapy vector (AAV2.CAG.TPP1) prior to the onset of retinal function impairment partially preserved retinal function through end-stage neurological disease at approximately 10 months of age. The vector transduced primarily cells of the inner retina and resulted in transgene expression for at least 6 months after treatment. There was also transgene expression in the retinal pigment epithelium. As with intravitreal ERT, a side effect was intraocular inflammation characterized by anterior and posterior uveitis. Inflammation was only partially alleviated by treatment with various anti-inflammatory medications. These results support further investigation to develop this approach to preserve vision in CLN2 disease. To date, infusion of TPP1-expressing mesenchymal stem cells into the cerebrospinal fluid has not been effective in treating central nervous system pathology in CLN2 disease. So far, with two minor exceptions, this method has not extended lifespan, slowed neurological disease progression or impeded brain atrophy. These exceptions, a slightly increased lifespan of one dog and temporarily improved performance on a cognitive test by another, may be indicative of some therapeutic benefit in those dogs. Work is ongoing to determine why this approach has not been successful and to modify the approach to enhance the potential for efficacy. This current work suggests that reducing the in vitro expansion of MSCs and/or removing immunosuppressive medications from the protocol may have improved efficacy, since these modifications were implemented for the dogs that demonstrated slight increases in lifespan and cognitive function. However, even in these two dogs any improvements were minor. Lack of success could be due to failure of the MSCs to survive long-term in the CNS or to secrete therapeutic amounts of hTPP1. Future studies could include alternative delivery methods and repeated injections over the disease course. Going forward, efforts should focus on determining if MSCs survive in the CNS, and if so for how long, as well as whether therapeutic concentrations of hTPP1 are obtainable with this method. The CLN5 form of NCL is characterized by progressive neurological decline and vision loss. As with CLN2 disease, a CLN5 canine model disease would be a valuable resource for testing potential therapeutic interventions. We characterized visual system pathology in five Golden Retrievers homozygous for a two base pair deletion and frameshift in the canine ortholog of CLN5. The dogs exhibited visual impairment by 22 months of age, progressive decline in ERG amplitudes primarily affecting cones and altered visual evoked potential recordings indicating impaired visual signal processing in the brain. While there were no gross retinal abnormalities by 23 months of age, there was extensive storage material accumulation in the retina and occipital cortex by 20 months of age. The visual system pathology in these dogs was similar to that seen in human patients. The baseline data obtained from the untreated affected dogs with CLN5 disease will serve as a foundation for designing therapeutic intervention studies.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Neuroscience, Interdisciplinary Program</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88127</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88127</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Dongjin</given_name>\\n      <surname>Kwak</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Ba</given_name>\\n      <surname> Heather-Leigh</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Dynamics of democracy aid allocation : from democratic donors to authoritarian regimes</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The purpose of this thesis is to analyze democracy aid allocation mechanisms between Western donors and authoritarian regimes in recipient countries. The theoretical mechanism explains how strategic choices of donors and recipient countries based on their interests affect the composition of democracy aid. As a part of democracy promotion policy, Western donors have increased democracy aid after the end of the Cold War. They provide various types of democracy aid targeting the advancement of democratic institutions, practices, and norms in authoritarian regimes. I classify democracy aid into two types: regime-compatible democracy aid and regime-incompatible democracy aid based on authoritarian regimes&apos; preference regarding democracy aid. Then, I discuss that donors&apos; strategic choice based on security and/or economic interests changes the shape of democracy aid patterns. The empirical findings from the analyses of U.S. democracy aid toincreased regime-compatible democracy aid to their client states. Moreover, authoritarian regimes secure more regimecompatible democracy aid using their leverage over the U.S., when they have a higher political instability. The findings suggest that the strategic choices of donors and recipient countries affect decisions on types of democracy aid and shape the democracy aid allocation patterns.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Political Science</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88128</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88128</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Bryan M.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Lada</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Gates</given_name>\\n      <surname> Kent S.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Lipid vesicle fusion as a vehicle to study transmembrane protein interactions</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Alzheimer&apos;s disease, among other neurologically degenerative diseases, has been linked to protein-enzyme interactions that originate within the transmembrane domain of a cell. The lipid environment that houses these interactions lends difficulty to studying intramembrane interactions, often making for time consuming data analysis. Lengthy data interpretation on top of the rate in which protein-enzyme interactions take place creates a need for a method to overcome these obstacles. The use of lipid vesicle fusion to apply a margin of control over the time frame of interaction combined with deep probing spectroscopic techniques can minimize the interference of the lipid environment. Deep ultraviolent resonance Raman (dUVRR) is a vibrational spectroscopic technique that probes along the protein backbone that allows for removal of lipid environmental interference through background subtraction. Lipid vesicle fusion has been demonstrated by mixing lipid vesicles comprised of oppositely charged head groups (cationic 1,2-diaurroyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1-rac-glycerol) (DLPG)) and anionic 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphocholine (12:0 EPC) or 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphocholine (14:0 EPC)) of equivalent or varying aliphatic tail length, up to a 2-carbon difference. The fluorescent dye, 8-aminonapthalene 1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS), paired with the quencher, p-xylene-bis-pyridiumbromide (DPX), are separately encased in either DLPG or 12:0 EPC/14:0 EPC, respectively, in aqueous solution, and evidence of lipid vesicle fusion is provided by monitoring fluorescence intensity of ANTS as the two solutions are mixed, resulting in the closing proximity of ANTS and DPX observed as a decrease in fluorescence intensity. Additional evidence is provided by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of both independent vesicle solutions and their mixture showing an increase in hydrodynamic radius (Rh). In addition, cohesion of similarly sized lipids is demonstrated, as DLPG (12-carbon chain) fails to fuse with cationic lipids of chain length 16 carbons or longer. Circular dichroism (CD) is a spectroscopic technique that uses left and right-handed polarized light to obtain the overall secondary structure of proteins. Shown is the use of CD to probe the secondary structure and the changes incurred on PolyLA7 (PLA7), a model ?-helical peptide when placed in a transmembrane or hydrophobic environment, through a change in the lipid environment. PLA7 was inserted in DLPG lipid vesicles and then mixed in solution with lipid vesicles comprised of 14:0 EPC. CD spectra were obtained pre and post vesicle fusion, demonstrating the use of lipid fusion as a means to combine membrane embedded proteins of interest while still being able to observe changes that take place. Finally, we propose an on-demand lipid fusion system in which two separate lipid vesicles could be co-suspended in solution and then chemically or photonically induced to fuse. A titration was performed to obtain the pKa of a synthesized pH inducible cationic lipid (pHiCL). The pHiCL is a dipicolylamine with an attached 12-carbon aliphatic tail. The pHiCL was titrated while suspended in an aqueous environment and while inserted into a lipid vesicle comprised of DLPC, a net neutral lipid also with a 12-carbon length aliphatic tail. The pHiCL will be the first component of a two-part system in which a photoacid (PA) will be used to protonate the pHiCL in solution giving rise to cationic and anionic surfaced lipid vesicles causing vesicle fusion to occur.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Chemistry</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88129</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88129</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Julio Cesar</given_name>\\n      <surname>Loya</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Enriquez</given_name>\\n      <surname> Maithe</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Salud paso por paso : a culturally-tailored physical activity intervention with hispanic adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Limited information is available regarding culturally-tailored physical activity (PA) interventions for Hispanic adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A community-partnered approach was used to examine a novel culturally-tailored PA intervention using a pre-post, no control group design. The intervention consisted of six weekly 45-minute sessions for participants to engage in PA led by the researcher. A total of 21 individuals participated in the study. The typical participant was a 53-year-old female (90 percent) Hispanic adult living with T2DM with low acculturation. On average, before the intervention, the participants walked 10,285 (sd 14,779) steps per week with 43.4 (sd 68.1) minutes of PA per week. Despite implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention was feasible and acceptable, and 19 (90.5 percent) participants attended all intervention sessions. There were significant increases in steps per week (p=0.007; d=1.03) and minutes of PA per week (p=0.000; d=1.62). Findings suggest that Salud Paso por Paso has promise as a strategy to enhance PA behaviors in the priority population. A randomized, controlled trial with a larger study sample is warranted to examine efficacy and impact on the diabetes health outcomes of Hispanic adults with T2DM.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Nursing/Distance Mediated Option</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88130</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88130</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Brigid R.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Marriott</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Hawley</given_name>\\n      <surname> Kristin M.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Longitudinal, naturalistic study of training and support for implementation of evidence-based youth mental health practices among community providers</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Ongoing training and implementation support for mental health (MH) providers may help to bridge the often-noted research-to-practice gap in community MH care. However, MH providers typically have limited ability to access training or implementation support in evidence-based practices (EBPs). To address this need, the current study describes the reach and impact of a county-wide youth MH initiative aimed at increasing youths&apos; and families&apos; access to effective youth MH services by providing free EBP training and implementation support to MH service providers. Specifically, the initiative offered 1) formal workshops focused on specific EBPs, 2) a biweekly learning community, 3) individual case consultation or supervision, and 4) a confidential online session-bysession clinical feedback system. To evaluate the training initiative, we employed a mixed methods approach within a naturalistic, longitudinal design. Providers (N = 717) were asked to complete an initiatrainings and on a yearly basis thereafter (n = 255 completed at least one follow-up assessment). Measures included demographics, clinical practice information, self-reported confidence in treating youths with various problem types, organizational implementation climate, and EBP knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Additionally, we completed individual, semi-structured, qualitative interviews with a stratified purposeful sampling of providers (n = 13) based on level of participation in the training. While the training initiative had high reach, far fewer providers ultimately engaged in training. Results suggested providers who were trainees, who had higher baseline knowledge of EBPs, who used common evidence-based strategies more extensively, and who used other therapy strategies less extensively, engaged in more training. A provider&apos;s stage of career (i.e., being a pre-service trainee or post-graduate provider) consistently showed differences in training outcomes, with trainees haviEBPs, using common evidence-based strategies and other therapy strategies less extensively, and self-reporting less confidence in their effectiveness than post-graduate providers. Contrary to hypotheses, quantity and method of training were less consistently associated with change in training outcomes. Rapid qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews complemented and expanded upon the quantitative results, illuminating provider, organizational, system, practical, and training activity-specific barriers and facilitators to training engagement and EBP implementation. Implications for future research and training initiatives are discussed in light of these findings.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Psychology/Clinical Psychology</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88131</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88131</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Palwasha Khan</given_name>\\n      <surname>Marwat</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Crawford-Rossi</given_name>\\n      <surname> Emily R.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Social justice leadership in rural Pakistan : a constructivist grounded theory study of private school leaders</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This qualitative constructivist-grounded theory (C-GT) study aimed to explore how Pakistani school leaders (PSL) conceptualize and enact social-justice-oriented leadership (if they do) to combat educational and sociocultural inequities to support marginalized students. This study collected data from 11 rural school leaders, over 11 primary and secondary private schools that educate marginalized students, including low-income families, girls, and minority groups in rural areas surrounding Islamabad. Utilizing social justice leadership (SJL) and mental models (MM) as a conceptual framework, I undertook an in-depth, semi-structured interview protocol with each school leader in addition to artifact collection, analytical memos, and diagrams. The emerging grounded theory is a five-step model identifying participants&apos; MM of SJL and exploring their views and actions to address the educational inequities for marginalized students. The findings suggest that school leaders conceptualized and emarginalized students&apos; access to high-quality education that was context-appropriate and encouraged critical awareness. However, most PSL had not received formal training in school leadership and shared some conflicting and problematic MM of leadership as adult-centered, hierarchical, and savior-like. This finding diverges from existing literature on SJL, which is democratic, inclusive, and empowering all stakeholders. Based on the results of this study, MM was a useful lens to explore PSLs&apos; views of justice and equity and how they subsequently enacted social justice to address inequities prevalent in their schools and communities to support marginalized students.

Mounting evidence suggests that dysfunctional decision making contributes to the development and maintenance of addiction and related behaviors. This study explored the effects of acute alcohol intoxication on decision making under risk. Regular drinkers were recruited for a within subjects, placebo controlled, alcohol administration study. They completed a decision-making task at peak alcohol intoxication and at a time matched assessment in a placebo condition, as well as several baseline measures. The aim of this study was to examine whether alcohol intoxication impacts risk attitude. The associations between risk attitude and related personality traits, problematic alcohol use, and alcohol related risk-taking behaviors were also tested. The results of the study suggest that intoxicated risk attitude, and not risk attitude in the placebo condition, is associated with indices of alcohol consumption and to a lesser extent, alcohol consequences. Alcohol intoxication did not significantly impact risk attitude classification. Risk attitude was not associated with impulsive personality traits, alcohol expectancies, or risk-taking behaviors. While risk attitude may have utility for identifying those who are at risk for alcohol problems, tasks designed to assess behavior specific decision processes may be useful for understanding risky patterns of decision making.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Psychology/Clinical Psychology</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88133</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88133</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Toby M.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Mills</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Thompson</given_name>\\n      <surname> Aaron M.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Supporting disaster impacted youth : evaluation of a universally delivered online mindfulness intervention</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">There is an increase in youth-reported traumatic stress, youth behavioral health problems, and an upward trend in the prevalence and severity of large-scale disasters within the US. Youth are especially vulnerable to adverse behavioral health problems following a disaster. Many young people do not seek treatment for their behavioral health problems and this discrepancy is magnified by various obstacles to successfully implementing school-based behavioral health interventions to youth impacted by disasters. Youth experiencing internalizing symptoms and youth of color are disproportionately impacted by disaster-related stress and are less likely to receive behavioral health interventions after a disaster. As such, researching the impact of universally delivered programs for this population is warranted. The current study seeks to examine the feasibility and initial efficacy of an online adaptation of the Dynamic Mindfulness program in a quasi-experimental, within-group/ pretest-posttest design, with 44 youth, ages 11-17. The evidence demonstrates that the online adaptation of the selected youth mindfulness program was feasible, acceptable, and related to significant, short-term, pretest to posttest improvements in several of the targeted outcomes and reveals a significant relationship between youth-reported mindfulness and various social and emotional outcomes within study participants, warranting continued inquiry within this scope of research.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Social Work</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88134</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88134</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Mohammad Hasan</given_name>\\n      <surname>Mobarok</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Thompson</given_name>\\n      <surname> Wyatt</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Three essays on food security, agricultural productivity, and commodity basis</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The proposed research is constructed around the theme of food security, agricultural productivity, and commodity basis. The first paper analyzes the impacts of COVID-19 on the Bangladesh rice market within the framework of a partial equilibrium regime-switching model. We provide an initial estimate of the short- and long-run effects of COVID-19 on the Bangladesh rice market and food security sustainability by comparing baseline projections. We analyze the effect of shocks in policies related to trade, public stock, and productivity on rice supply, demand, and food security dimensions. Finally, we assess the effectiveness of these policies to smooth out shocks that may arise from a future pandemic like COVID-19. In the second essay, we analyze the relationship between women&apos;s empowerment in agriculture and Bangladesh rice farm productivity change and its components, which include efficiency change, technological change, and scale efficiency change. We employ the non-parametric Malmquist approach and bootstrap regression method. We find that improvements in women&apos;s empowerment in agriculture, specifically enhancing their ability to make independent choices regarding agricultural production, have a statistically significant positive association with productivity change, efficiency change, and technical change. We also find that lowering the gender parity gap is positively related to improving the productivity of the sample farms. In the third essay, we analyze the effect of precipitation variations, namely local, growing season, and regional precipitation, on Missouri corn and soybean basis. We document statistically significant linear and nonlinear basis responses in corn and soybean models for local and growing season precipitation variations. We also find a statistically significant moderating effect of port distance measure on the curvilinearity of the association between regional precipitation and soybean basis.

Despite such improvement, the gaps in high level courses enrollment among racially or socioeconomically different student groups still remain with those marginalized students underrepresented in the high level courses. The present study focused on another marginalized group of students, English language learners (ELLs) and sought to identify school practices that may improve ELLs&apos; access to advanced math courses in high school. Using the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, the present study examined three key school practices in association with ELLs&apos; taking advanced math: i) student choice-based math placement policies, ii) math encouraging programs for underrepresented studentudy found that only math PLCs had a statistically significant association with the probability of taking advanced math courses, net of prior achievement and other student- and school-level factors. The math PLCs examined here represented a collaboration among math teachers to learn effective teaching methods and discuss their teaching/learning belief for students including ELLs or under-performing students. It found no differential effects of school practices and ELLs&apos; taking advanced math courses, the main focus of this study. However, the findings indicate that ELLs can also benefit from high quality math PLCs as much as other students. The key finding of the present study suggests the possible area that school leadership and educators should develop to improve students&apos; access to advanced math courses net of their prior achievement. Particularly for ELLs, the finding suggests that training content area teachers may help ELLs more readily access academicarformance. Most importantly, considering taking advanced math in high school is a critical issue for ELLs in regard to their participation in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) workforce in the future, there should be more research that explicitly investigates school policies and practices that may facilitate ELLs&apos; access to higher level courses in high school. keywords: English language learners, High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, math professional learning communities, student choice, advanaced math</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Educational Leadership and Policy/Ed Policy Studies</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88136</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88136</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Nicholas C.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Neibergall</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Sanchez</given_name>\\n      <surname> Francisco J.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Older adult gay & bisexual male veterans\\' perception of access and cultural competence within the health care system</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Previous research has consistently identified health disparities among minority groups, including members of the LGBTQ community. The role of the health care system itself in creating, sustaining, or confronting these disparities has received only modest attention. This qualitative dissertation study examines the experiences of older adult gay and bisexual cisgender male Veterans and their perception of provider cultural competence and the organizational climate of the systems in which they receive health care. An existing theoretical framework, the Origins of Health Care Disparities Model, was used in the conceptualization of this research. Case study method was used to guide the research process and subsequent data analysis. Eight participants (MdnAge = 73, Range = 65-82) from across the United States were interviewed remotely, and both within-case and crosscase themes were generated. Results showed most participants were hesitant about integrating their sexual orientation to their degrees. Participants emphasized the importance of a strong clinical relationship with providers and offered diverse opinions about the impact of previous homophobic incidents and their military background. They suggested strategies for medical providers to provide more culturally informed health care. Specifically, they expressed hope for greater representation of gay health care staff and increased training for doctors and medical trainees to work with older adult gay patients.

Since these interesting properties are mostly observed around metamaterials&apos; local resonances/anti-resonance, resonance-based acoustic metamaterials are most popular in developing metamaterials. Employing resonance-based unnatural born properties such as effective negative mass density, effective negative bulk modulus, and acoustic hyper-damping on designing noise control solutions can give excellent devices showing such high performance that conventional acoustic material cannot achieve. This dissertation is an effort to employ acoustic metamaterials in designing efficient noise control. First, membrane-type acoustic metamaterials (MAM) will be employed to design a lightweight acoustic panel with high sound transmission loss (STL) in broadband at low frequencies. Negative density at around the anti-resonance of MAM gives it high capability on blocking sound. A double MAM-layer structure is proposed to double the STL performance of unit cells theoretically. Therein, simulation by using COMSOL Multiphysics is the main tool to optimize the unit cell design, panel structure, and effect of panel frame&apos;s vibration. Fabrication of the optimal design and experiments are also conducted to verify the calculation and simulation predictions. In addition to the acoustic panel, MAM is used to design a highly efficient acoustic energy harvester working at low frequencies. A magnet coin is deployed close to a magnet coil attached to the mass of MAM. The maximum oscillation of the coil due to MAM&apos;s first local resonance will induce a strong electric current inside the coil. Hence, energy can be harvested by an external resistor representing loads of harvesting devices. A complete theoretical model of the harvester is also developed in order to optimize its performance. Multiphysics simulation is conducted to verify the theoretical predictions. Besides MAM, Helmholtz has been used to design a high-performance and broadband acoustic silencer. Specifically, five slit-type Helmholtz resonators, which possess a massive viscous area, are packed together to create a single-layer silencer. In turn, two single-layer silencers are combined to form a double-layer silencer, which in theory double performance on noise blocking of the single-layer silencer. Theoretical models of slit-type Helmholtz resonators and silencers are developed completely and well validated with simulation and experimental results. Finally, Fano resonance resulting from the coupling between resonant and non-resonant channels will be explored and employed to design an ultra-broadband acoustic barrier with high ventilation. The resonant channel is generally represented a space-coiling channel, and the non-resonant channel represents ventilation or a straight and short channel. First, the formation of coupling Fano resonance will be theoretically addressed. Subsequently, acoustic hyper-damping is proposed by integrating thin acoustic foams into velocity anti-nodes in the resonant channel. In the end, an ultra-broadband acoustic barrier with high ventilation and STL is designed by employing three rows of hyper-dampened unit cells. Fabrication and experiment also are conducted to verify the simulation prediction.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88138</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88138</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Jane Marie</given_name>\\n      <surname>Niemeyer</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Lupo</given_name>\\n      <surname> Anthony</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Historical rainfall analysis and climate implications for agriculture in midwest United States</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">A historical analysis of precipitation using 72 years of data from Midwest stations focuses on the implications of climate change for agricultural interests. The number of precipitation events, consecutive days of precipitation, and a Fourier transformation on precipitation are included. Although increased precipitation can be of benefit in agricultural production resulting in yield benefits in the Midwest, excessive rainfall events lead to runoff, which does not improve soil water content and plant available water. To examine the beneficial nature of rainfall events in the Midwest, rainfall retention is estimated using the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS/SCS) method. This method can be described briefly as an empirical formula estimating the soil&apos;s ability to store water and the amount of runoff. It was found that not only has rainfall increased but so have the number of rainfall days and the number of consecutive days of rainfall. To appricultural focus, spring and fall rainfall days were also found to increase implying that farmers may have fewer days to complete fieldwork in the current climate. With increasing precipitation, the potential for runoff also increases, losing valuable water needed for crops and contributing to lost nutrients in the soil.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Soil, Environmental and Atmospheric Sciences/Natural Resources</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88139</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88139</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Roberto</given_name>\\n      <surname>Nunez</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Cutkosky</given_name>\\n      <surname> Dale</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Volumes of line bundles on schemes</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The volume of a line bundle is an invariant defined in terms of a limit superior.

We show that volumes are limits in two classes of schemes that are not necessarily generically reduced: codimension one subschemes of projective varieties such that their components of maximal dimension contain normal points, and projective schemes whose nilradical squared equals zero.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Mathematics</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88140</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88140</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Chan Jeong</given_name>\\n      <surname>Park</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Rottinghaus</given_name>\\n      <surname> Patrick</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Expanding social cognitive career theory : academic satisfaction of female students of color in STEM</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Underrepresentation of women and students of color has been a longstanding issue in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Although the gender gap has narrowed in several STEM fields in recent years, female students, especially those of color, continue to face challenges in thriving in their chosen fields. The present study examined factors that contribute to these students&apos; academic satisfaction, based on the satisfaction model of Social Cognitive Career Theory. Perceived discrimination and proactive personality were selected as an environmental obstacle and a person input in the model, respectively, as they were postulated to be especially relevant to these students. In addition, critical consciousness was included as an additional socio-cognitive variable. Data from 585 female college students of color (Mage = 21.42, SDage = 3.25; nBlack = 174, nLatina = 171, nAsian = 240) were collected through Qualtrics. Multigroup measurement invariance tests and multigroup sing were conducted to examine the racial/ethnic differences in constructs and their interrelationships. The findings showed that the three samples were equivalent at the scalar level and the proposed model fit the data from the three samples well. Significant racial/ethnic differences in several latent means and structural paths were observed. Theoretical, clinical, and institutional implications are discussed in light of the findings. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Ed, School and Counseling Psychology/Counseling Psych</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88141</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88141</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Tapas</given_name>\\n      <surname>Paul</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Mueser</given_name>\\n      <surname> Peter</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Three essays on labor economics</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This dissertation addresses labor market issues.

If this scenario happens, then many townspeople in a rural area will lose their only Walmart store, which has been part of the town for decades. There are many studies on the impact of Walmart&apos;s entry and presence in towns. However, investigating the effects of Walmart when they leave small towns is still rare. For this reason, this study is focused on addressing the impact of Walmart store closures in small towns in Missouri. The purpose of this study is to identify factors affecting the residents&apos; perception of and response toward the impact of Walmart&apos;s store closure in Rural Areas. Our conceptual framework is designed to assess household vulnerability and incorporate food insecurity factors to capture how vulnerability and resilience in rural communities change because of the closure of a Walmart store. This approach may help us better understand the linkages between community vulnerability and community resilience. Using a mixed-method design, we explored the residents&apos; perceptions, opinions, and experiences regarding the closing of Walmart. Data from both the qualitative phase (observation, semi-structured interview, group discussion, and document analysis) and quantitative phase (community-based drop-off and pick-up surveys) of this study then mixed in the final analysis to provide a more detailed and complete description of the effect of Walmart store closures in rural Missouri. We found that people were overwhelmingly disappointed and angry when Walmart closed in their area in 2017. Most residents said they felt disappointed (46 percent) and angry (41 percent) about Walmart&apos;s decision. There was a change in households&apos; attitudes and shopping habits after Walmart left these towns, including a significant decline (54.9 percent) in shopping frequency among residents who often shop at Walmart. Not having Wal sense of losing pride in being part of the town. When Caruthersville and Piedmont still had Walmart in town, it became the center of community for the surrounding towns and the entire county. The number of households that fall into vulnerability categories (very lowvulnerable, low-vulnerable, vulnerable, and very vulnerable) is calculated and obtained from Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA). The data showed that most households fell into a vulnerable (39.8 percent) and low-vulnerable situation (34.6 percent) after Walmart left and were able to cope with this stressor. Households in the neighboring towns (Patterson, Williamsville, and Greenville) that were 10-15 miles from Piedmont also had a high percentage of vulnerable groups (47.6 percent) and very vulnerable households (6.5 percent). Based on this study, the Walmart store&apos;s closure in Piedmont had a bigger impact on both the households within the host town and their neighboring towns. Our findings also confirmed that many residents in these areas rely on government assistance programs, especially SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program), the most extensive federal nutrition program in the U.S. About 43.7 percent of households in Caruthersville, 25.5 percent of households in Piedmont, and 24.4 percent of households in the neighboring town are SNAP recipients. These findings further prove that SNAP recipients and community food bank/pantry users were more sensitive to Walmart&apos;s store closure. While SNAP benefits provided valuable support to many households, the retail mobility -- increased proximity to small retailers and decreased proximity to many large ones (Walmart) -- would negatively affect townspeople. This study suggests that Policymakers and public health experts need to work closely to ensure healthier and more equitable food systems since small retailers may provide limited access to fresh and healthy foods. Future research can also evaluate the impact of existing small retailers - that authorized for SNAPof the rural community.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Rural Sociology</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88143</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88143</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Amy E.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Reed</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Bullock</given_name>\\n      <surname> Linda</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Does geography matter? comparing maternal stressors to birth outcomes</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Background: The US continues to see rising trends in the incidence of maternal morbidity and mortality, which contributes to poor infant birth outcomes of preterm birth and low birth weight. The purpose of this dissertation study was to examine the relationship between the experience of stress and birth outcomes of weight and gestational age based on whether the mother resided in a rural or urban location in the state of Missouri. Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services PRAMS survey between 2007-2019. There were 15,938 respondents -- 11,475 urban and 4,463 rural. Stress measures included responses from 13 items on the PRAMS survey related to the experience of stress within the 12 months before delivery of their infant. A mean stress score for each participant was created, which was an average of the 13 stressors experienced. The 13 stressors were also grouped into four different domains: Community, Family/Relationshipd Health. Participant responses are tied to birth certificate data to obtain outcome variables related to infant birth weight (&lt;2500 grams) and gestational age (&lt;37 weeks) at time of delivery. Univariate and multivariate models were analyzed for the total sample and also for urban and rural participants with and without covariates. Results: Rural childbearing women were younger, less likely to have received prenatal care during the first trimester and more likely to have smoked cigarettes than urban childbearing women. Urban women were more likely to have education beyond high school, and more likely to use alcohol during pregnancy. Similar to other research, Black women were more likely to experience PTB or have a LBW infant than other race/ethnicities. The number of stressors reported by both urban and rural women is similar, with rural women reporting slightly more. The experience of stress is significant for both urban and rural women, even when controlling for covariates. Stress scores significantly predicted low birth weight and preterm birth for urban participants. The four different categories of grouped stress scores were not significant for either urban or rural participants and did not significantly predict low birth weight or preterm birth. Conclusion: Health care providers should screen women for stressors related to the social determinants of health in order to provide opportunities for support and intervention. Policies that ensure access to convenient, appropriate obstetric resources for pregnant women, regardless of location could improve outcomes. Research that seeks to understand differences in health between rural and urban populations should consider additional measures related to urban and rural classification of participants.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Nursing/Distance Mediated Option</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88144</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88144</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Christine</given_name>\\n      <surname>Sanders</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Hendrickson</given_name>\\n      <surname> Mary</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Small-medium enterprise experiences of financial service in urban and rural settings : a phenomenological study of a changing community finance landscape and the sustainable finance narrative</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Relationships between small-medium size businesses (&apos;SME&apos;) and community banks are complex, meaningful, and often described as characteristically &quot;opaque&quot;. This study offers a conceptual framework for exploring this &quot;opaqueness&quot; from the perspective of SMEs and community financiers engaged in the process of community finance. Insights into the experiential dynamics of SMEs and community financiers co-navigating the financial service landscape offers an exploratory frame for investigations of interactive capacity, knowledge formation, and reflexive orientations. The implications of what transpires between SMEs and their community financiers can be far-reaching and of particular importance as the financial service landscape evolves to respond to calls for more &apos;sustainable finance&apos; to support the goals of Agenda 2030, conveyed as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study findings suggest that multi-dimensional aspects of community financee not well understood. Future research and practitioner ideation is suggested around the importance of placing community finance, as a facilitative process, within emerging &apos;sustainable finance&apos; frameworks. Doing so offers an enhanced social-ecological lens for exploring the role, effects, and effectiveness of community finance in the 21st century.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Rural Sociology</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88145</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88145</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Aly</given_name>\\n      <surname>Savala</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Herman</given_name>\\n      <surname> Keith C.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>The roles of attachment style and maternal depression in the development of childhood depression</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This study aimed to determine how stable parent ratings of their infant&apos;s temperament/attachment style is across one year of development and establish if there is a specific pathway that leads to child depression and or internalizing and externalizing behaviors originating with maternal depression or insecure attachment styles between the infant and their mothers. The data for this study was collected as part of a multisite, randomized trial of Hawaii&apos;s Healthy Start Program (HSP) (Duggan et al., 2004). The Hawaii Healthy Start Program (HSP) is a home visiting program targeted at families at-risk of child abuse and neglect. The racial and ethnic characteristics for total participants are as follows: 12 percent identified as White, 9 percent identified as Asian, 13 percent identified as Pacific Islander, 20 percent identified as Filipino, 20 percent identified as Native Hawaiian, 27 percent identified as Black/ Multiracial (Duggan et al. 1999). The mean age for participating mothers was 23.4 (SD = 5.8) and 68 percent of the families had incomes belopoverty line (Duggan et al., 1999). The following measures were used in the present study: The Bate&apos;s Attachment Scale, The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), The Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), and The Children&apos;s Depression Inventory (CDI). Unlike the majority of literature, the present findings suggest that maternal depression and attachment issues during the first year of life served as only a very modest risk for future child internalizing symptoms. Similar to the findings regarding child depression, relations between parent and teacher rated externalizing symptoms, maternal depression, and attachment were fairly small. Only for parent rated externalizing symptoms there was a small association between externalizing score and maternal depression and a small association between parent rating of externalizing behaviors and parent ratings of child attachment.

Evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars with carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below unity are known as oxygen-rich stars. O-rich stars are surrounded by dust shells containing mineral species dominated by silicate dust grains. In this dissertation, I examine whether dust grains around evolved, oxygen-rich AGB stars have any correlation with maser emission, and to understand the connection, if any, between specific types of maser emission and dust spectral features. I have investigated several methods of continuum elimination using spectroscopy data for the archetypal dusty AGB star, Mira. I have investigated the &#126;10[mu]m and &#126;18[mu]m spectral features in the continuum-eliminated spectrum including peak position, barycenter, and full width half maxima (FWHM). The positions and widthved spectral features were compared with those seen in laboratory spectra. I then looked for a correlation between maser emission and dust spectral features in a sample of Mira variables. The types of masers have been identified, and peak positions, barycenter positions, and FWHM have been measured for the sample spectra. The results show that the method of continuum elimination matters for correct identification of dust minerals, while varying the temperature and precise continuum shapes do not have a major effect on the positions of spectral features. Observed astronomical silicate features are complex and indicate the need for different compositions of minerals. Finally, there does not appear to be a correlation between the presence of a maser and dust spectral features based on the information available for analysis.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Physics</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88147</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88147</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Joonhong</given_name>\\n      <surname>Ahn</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Mueser</given_name>\\n      <surname> Peter</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Essays on intergenerational transmission in Korea</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This dissertation studies the effects of parents&apos; resources on children&apos;s labor market outcomes in Korea. The educational structure in Korea has changed substantially with rapid economic growth over the last several decades. There is a substantial difference between parents and children&apos;s average educational attainment. Because of economic development and schooling difference between parents and children, the intergenerational transmission of economic status may show different patterns than in developed countries. In addition, parents&apos; health problems may play a role to limit children&apos;s educational attainment by reducing parenting quality during early childhood or adolescent periods. The dissertation estimates various causal channels of parents&apos; economic resources to children. The dissertation consists of three chapters. In Chapter 1, I investigate the intergenerational relationship of earnings and education in Korea with particular attention to the trajectories of vocational and academic high school graduates. I estimate that the intergenerational earnings elasticity in Korea is 0.4, which is consistent with previous studies. When educational attainment of fathers and child are controlled, parental earnings are positively associated with children&apos;s earnings, although the association decreases to 0.08 (0.10) for sons (daughters). Sons whose fathers completed only a vocational high school degree have a greater chance of attending college than sons whose fathers completed only an academic high school degree. A college degree of a father helps children to have higher earnings and to increase their chance of attending and graduating from college. Father&apos;s education has a stronger impact on children&apos;s earnings when children&apos;s educational attainment is higher. A vocational high school degree reduces a child&apos;s probability of attending and completing college compared to academic high school graduates. However, notwithstanding this educational disadvantage, vocational graduates do not appear to suffer substantially in terms of expected earnings, relative to academic high school graduates. In the second chapter, I estimate the average causal effects of parents&apos; educational attainment on the educational attainment of children in Korea using a new method, the nonparametric bounds approach. This approach does not require the assumption of homogeneous and linear effects of parental schooling. It also uses relatively weaker assumptions, monotone treatment response and monotone treatment selection, than assumption underlying other methods and is more amenable to testing. With the additional assumption of monotone instrumental variables, it provides the tightest bounds on the average treatment effects (ATE) that an increase in parents&apos; education increases children&apos;s educational success. It also shows the effects are overestimated in simple regression models. The third chapter examines the effects of parental health on children&apos;s educational attainment. Parental illness changes parenting quality both by affecting family wealth and in other ways that influence children&apos;s labor market outcomes. Parental health problems can especially have relatively larger impacts on children&apos;s education when children are in either primary or secondary education than other periods. Longitudinal data from the Korean Labor Income Panel Survey, for the period 1998 - 2018, enables me to examine parental illness effects in the early childhood and adolescent period on ultimate educational achievement. Empirical application in this paper pays attention to situations that each parent&apos;s either unexpected or chronic health problems change children&apos;s human capital.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Economics</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88042</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88042</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Richard Shawn</given_name>\\n      <surname>Abrahams</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Pires</given_name>\\n      <surname> J.

In this dissertation, I leverage syntenic information in concert with sequence data to draw connections between evolutionary mechanisms, species divergence, and trait innovation. In Chapter I, I review the major themes that ties my dissertation research together, highlighting important mechanisms at work in evolutionary complexity and introducing the system of which it will be a part. In Chapter II, I use a phylogenomic approach to better understand species relationships within the tribe. I utilize transcriptome sequences and genome derived synteny information to improve orthology detection over standard sequence similarity approaches and gain greater insight into the relationships of the tribe. I also implement differential fractionation rate orthology inference information to address gene tree-species tree incongruence. In Chapter III, as published in Abrahams et al., 2020, I utilize a microsynteny network and phylogenetic inference to investigate the origin and diversification of the MAM/IPMS gene family. I uncover unique MAM-like genes found at the orthologous locus in the Cleomaceae that shed light on the transition from IPMS to MAM. In the Brassicaceae, I identify six distinct MAM clades across Lineages I, II, and III. I characterize the evolutionary impact and consequences of local duplications, transpositions, whole genome duplications, and gene fusion events, generating several new hypotheses on the function and diversity of the MAM locus.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Biological Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88041</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88041</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Kristin (Kris)</given_name>\\n      <surname>Budd</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Eggert</given_name>\\n      <surname> Lori S.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Conservation genetics of conflict in the Asian elephant, Elephas maximus</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) is an endangered species whose distribution spans 13 countries in south, southeast, and insular Asia. The primary threats to the survival of this species include direct conflict, primarily in the forms of poaching and crop-raiding, as well indirect conflict such as habitat loss and fragmentation. Due to the elephant&apos;s elusive behavior within their dense vegetative habitat and the fact that their large size presents handling dangers to researchers and elephants, research increasingly relies on noninvasive monitoring combined with a diverse assemblage of genetic tools. This dissertation uses conservation genetics to evaluate major conflict and conservation issues for Asian elephants. The first study, in the Bago Yoma region of Myanmar, evaluates the impact of direct human-conflict in a high-density area of humans and elephants. Here elephants are heavily impacted by the developing skin trade, and condensed populations frequently raid local farms forined the overall population structure and gained demographic insights as to what defines a crop-raider. The second study, conducted in the Nakai plateau elephant population of Lao PDR, compared and contrasted the diversity and demography of a population of high conservation value before and after the construction of a hydroelectric dam. The results revealed a seasonally shifting population, unique from the previous occupants of the plateau, and a decline in genetic diversity. In the final study, genetic data from across the species&apos; range was used to identify hotspots of genetic diversity despite marker selection bias, a problem frequently encountered in conservation genetic studies. The results highlight the evolutionary distinctiveness and conservation value of populations, particularly in southeast Asia, for conservation management of this iconic species.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Biological Sciences</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88043</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88043</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Joni</given_name>\\n      <surname>Burch</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Curs</given_name>\\n      <surname> Bradley</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Student perceptions of independent living skills development as a result of the residence hall experience</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This mixed-methods case study examined how students perceived the development of independent living skills because of their residence hall experience. Using Astin&apos;s (1993) Inputs-Environment-Outputs (IEO) framework to guide the research methodology and analyze data, this study highlighted the importance of students living with, and among, their peers in shared living space. Sharing living spaces with peers was found to be a key contributor to developing interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. Students expressed the importance of the residence hall experience during their first year and highlighted the relationship with their Resident Assistant as the most significant residence hall intervention strategy. Upperclass students discussed wanting fewer points of contact with residence hall staff, resources, and programs. Lastly, residence hall leadership positions (Resident Assistant and Hall Government involvement) were noted as significant contributors to developing independent living skills associated with interacting with others. Findings will inform adjustments to the Resident Assistant role in upperclass student living areas and help address specific learning strategies that students shared some helpful perspective and insight regarding their effectiveness (e.g., roommate agreement). This study established a research framework that will support future research regarding the residence hall experience.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Educational Leadership and Policy/Educational Leadership-Distance</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ed.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88044</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88044</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Evelyn</given_name>\\n      <surname>Cho</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Hawley</given_name>\\n      <surname> Kristin M.</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Toward effective and efficient treatment adherence monitoring : development of the cognitive behavioral therapy adherence measure</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Despite the large body of research demonstrating the efficacy of evidence-based practices (EBPs) for the most common youth mental health problems, EBPs are rarely used in usual care (UC). When EBPs are implemented in UC settings, there is a drop in adherence, and sometimes a drop in outcomes. Feasible and practical adherence monitoring tools may support high quality EBP delivery in UC. The current study examined the psychometric properties of the Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Adherence Measure (CBTAM), a suite of therapist-, parent-, and youth-reported measures of adherence to the core components of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for youth anxiety, depression, and behavior problems. Therapists, parents, and youths completed the CBTAM after every session throughout a six-session treatment. Coders coded a subset of treatment sessions using the CBTAM and other established observational coding systems for CBT adherence and alliance. Therapists were consistent with coders on their ratings of individual CBTAM items. Therapist, parent, and youth CBTAM item ratings were correlated with similar items on established observational measures of CBT adherence and alliance, and these correlations were higher than correlations between CBTAM items and dissimilar items on observational measures. CBTAM adherence scores predicted faster symptom improvement on some therapist- and parent-rated outcomes. Therapist and parent end-of-treatment ratings were consistent with observational coding measures of adherence and alliance. Findings demonstrate the promise of the CBTAM as a feasible adherence monitoring tool for routine care.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Psychology/Clinical Psychology</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88045</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88045</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Jinmyung</given_name>\\n      <surname>Choi</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Dorner</given_name>\\n      <surname> Lisa</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Generational status, social capital and family engagement in immigrant families</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This study highlighted the importance of social capital in understanding the disparity in family engagement across immigrant generations. Using the national representative data, the ELS:2002, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the relationships among generational status, social capital, and home- and school-based family engagement. The results suggested that social capital played an important role in immigrant home- and schoolbased family engagement. The findings of specific pathways through social capital in and outside the family to home- and school-based family engagement might make a tangible contribution to understanding of family engagement and immigrant generations. Further, the present research suggested that immigrant families were not only constrained from participating in their children&apos;s education, but also had their own strengths for family engagement such as positive expectations for and extensive communications with their children.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Educational Leadership and Policy/Ed Policy Studies</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88046</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88046</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Mackenzie</given_name>\\n      <surname>Cook</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Winter</given_name>\\n      <surname> Virginia Ramseyer</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Examining contraceptive use and perceived side effects among teen girls in rural Missouri</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In Missouri, there are 114 counties with 101 rural counties; 41 of these rural counties have teen pregnancy rates that vary from 42.4 to 90.1 per 1,000 (national rate is 43 per 1,000; Kost et al., 2017; TPPP, 2013). Nationally, teen pregnancy rates have been decreasing; however, some of the rural Missouri counties have seen an increase in pregnancy rates (e.g., Dunklin County saw an increase from 55.07 per 1,000 to 62.37 per 1,000, and Pettis County saw an increase from 38.43 per 1,000 to 43.07 per 1,000 from 2015-2016). Most literature on teen pregnancy and pregnancy prevention has focused on urban populations. This is problematic because many rural communities have characteristics that result in disparately high teen pregnancy rates. The theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) and the health belief model (Kirscht, 1974) provide a theoretical framework for the current study. This study aimed to better understand teen girls&apos; contraceptive use in rural Missouri specifically, how attid side effects, subjective norms about contraceptive use, and knowledge about contraceptive side effects relate to girls halting contraceptive use. A convenience sample of 183 girls from the 41 rural Missouri counties participated in an online survey. The majority of the sample identified as White (72.6 percent). Age and education levels varied; 10.9 percent 15 years old, 24 percent 16 years old, 23.5 percent 17 years old, 25.7 percent 18 years old, and 15.8 percent 19 years old; 40.4 percent completed high school or GED, 11.5 percent completed 8th grade, 24 percent completed some high school, 15.8 percent completed some college, 3.8 percent completed trade/technical/vocational training, 1.6 percent completed an associate&apos;s degree, and 0.5 percent completed a bachelor&apos;s degree. About half the sample identified as religious (54.6 percent). A series of logistic regression were performed in R version 3.4.1. The results showed that girls who perceived birth control pills to have major side effects were more likely to have experienced a side effect from contromeone important to them who supported the use of condoms, IUD, and birth control pills were more likely to experience a side effect and halt use. The girls who had experienced a side effect from contraceptive use and halted use were more likely to believe that they would become pregnant in the next year if not using any form of contraception. The girls who had not been told about side effects associated with contraceptives were more likely to associate major side effects with IUDs and birth control pills. This study greatly contributes to the literature regarding rural teens&apos; contraceptive use and how their attitudes and knowledge about perceived side effects informs the girls&apos; decision to use or halt contraceptive use. More research is needed to fully understand these factors and better improve intervention strategies as well as contraceptive counseling to reduce teen pregnancy rates in rural Missouri.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Social Work</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88047</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88047</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Mattina A.</given_name>\\n      <surname>Davenport</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Stichter</given_name>\\n      <surname> Janine</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>When they see us : an initial development and evaluation of a culturally responsive police interaction training for black adolescents with ASD</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The purpose of the current study was to conduct a qualitative and experimental analysis of a culturally informed police safety skills training for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Qualitative focus groups and interviews were used to inform study design, and intervention procedures by exploring perceived barriers to safe interactions with law enforcement officers (LEO), preferred training settings, desired treatment modalities, and culturally appropriate simulated contexts. The current study focused primarily on meeting the unique training needs of Black adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A single case design was used to evaluate the initial efficacy and acceptability of a culturally responsive training method. Preliminary evidence about the physiological ramifications of police contact were also collected to begin to examine the broader behavioral and psychophysiological nature of youth&apos;s experiences. Understanding whether police interactions led to chanrtisol and heart rate variability provided insight into the physiological costs of police presence among Black adolescents with ASD. The current project is innovative and novel in that it used the integrated perceptions and knowledge of Black caregivers, Black adolescents, and local law enforcement to develop training methodology based on local norms. No police-focused study has yet to consider the integral aspect of anxious behaviors and social abilities in ASD youth. The current experimental design included in-person simulated contexts that youth, and caregivers, endorsed as relevant to their normal lives, which greatly strengthened the ecological validity of the approach.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Ed, School and Counseling Psychology/School Psych, Certification</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88048</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88048</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Ivan Enrique</given_name>\\n      <surname>Davila Fadul</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Haslag</given_name>\\n      <surname> Joseph</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Effects of the fiscal policy on macroeconomic outcomes</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The dissertation consists in three chapters addressing the effects of fiscal policy on macroeconomic outcomes. In the first chapter, I take advantage of the scarcity of evidence on the effects of public spending on GDP growth in developing countries. Thus, the main focus is in the top five emerging economies, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, known as BRICS, that accounts for almost a quarter of world GDP have received little attention. Through an Auto-regressive Panel-Vector (P-VAR) model, using quarterly data from 1997Q1 to 2017Q4, I estimate that the government spending multiplier is 0.145 percent on impact (t=0), and a cumulative multiplier of -0.125 percent percent in 5 years. Also, I analyze how the results of the baseline model vary according to specification adjustments, different order of the variables, and the use of alternative trend removal mechanisms. The robustness analysis shows that the multiplier is sensitive to these changes, which provides evidence of the possible causes of the varied results. In the second chapter, I estimate the local fiscal multiplier using the literature on incumbency status and local spending. The literature suggests that regional authorities seek to in uence their voters through increases in government spending during the election years. Given this, I build an instrument based on term limits and electoral laws established in the Legislatures of the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, to estimate the local fiscal multiplier for the period of 2007-2016. My estimate of the fiscal multiplier in the baseline model is 1.274. Through a robustness check, my estimator uctuates between 1.208 and 1.239. My results are consistent with the estimations in the geographic cross-sectional multipliers literature for the United States. In the third and last chapter, I evaluated the fiscal policy effects in a dollarized Latin American economy such as Ecuador. Therefore, I estimate both the linear and state-dependent impact and cumulative multiplier for the period between 1991Q1 and 2019Q4. The main result shows that the linear impact multiplier is 0.79 and fades in the medium and long term. Furthermore, in expansions and recessions, the impact multiplier is 1.42 and 0.91, respectively. However, the effect disappears in the long run when dealing with expansions. On the other hand, in periods of recession, the cumulative multiplier is 0.64, significantly different from zero at a 90 percent confidence interval. The results suggest that the multipliers are distinct between states at a 5 percent level of significance.</jats:p>\\n   </jats:abstract>\\n   <approval_date>\\n    <month>7</month>\\n    <year>2021</year>\\n   </approval_date>\\n   <institution>\\n    <institution_name>University of Missouri--Columbia</institution_name>\\n    <institution_id type=\"ror\">https://ror.org/02ymw8z06</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"isni\">https://isni.org/isni/0000000121623504</institution_id>\\n    <institution_id type=\"wikidata\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q579968</institution_id>\\n    <institution_department>Economics</institution_department>\\n   </institution>\\n   <degree>Ph.D.</degree>\\n   <doi_data>\\n    <doi>10.32469/10355/88049</doi>\\n    <resource>https://hdl.handle.net/10355/88049</resource>\\n   </doi_data>\\n   </dissertation>\\n   <dissertation language=\"en\" publication_type=\"full_text\">\\n    <contributors>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"author\" sequence=\"first\">\\n      <given_name> Dinesh</given_name>\\n      <surname>Dhakal</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n     <person_name contributor_role=\"chair\" sequence=\"additional\">\\n      <given_name>Mueser</given_name>\\n      <surname> Peter</surname>\\n     </person_name>\\n   </contributors>\\n   <titles>\\n     <title>Role of agricultural cooperatives in poverty reduction in Nepal : an empirical analysis</title>\\n   </titles>\\n   <jats:abstract>\\n    <jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Cooperatives refer to producer-owned and controlled organizations that improve farmers&apos; livelihoods by correcting market failure. Policy makers consider cooperatives as an appropriate development approach for poverty alleviation of poor farmers for developing economies; therefore, the government of Nepal has been investing economic resources in this sector, prioritizing it as part of a strategy for poverty reduction. The number of coopertives have been increased substantially since 2007 and almost half of the coopertives are involved in agricultural sector. This dissertation research examines poor farmers&apos; access to agricultural cooperatives and the impact of membership on their crop income in Nepal. This study is based on a household survey of 573 rural farm families and Key Informant Interviews of 37 managers of agricultural cooperatives. In order to make the inferences on access and income gain, probit regression, matching, ordinary least square and two-stage least squares techniqpropriate identification strategies for a cross-sectional data. This study predicts cooperative membership with household characteristics (including demographic and geographic information) and village characteristics. In addition, some of our models use village location dummies rather than village characteristics. The analysis identifies some key determinants that influence cooperative membership. Those determinants are the ethnicity of a family, the ethnicity of a neighborhood, smallholder land size, distance to agricultural cooperatives, distance to the nearest local market, and distance to a motorable road. For the second research question, our estimates imply that cooperative membership may significantly impact family net crop income but not the rotal family income. Indeed, currently, agricultural cooperatives appear to be focused on financial services like savings and credit activities but are less concerned with agricultural production, and engage in almost no marketing activities. In addition to analyses based on our sample, this study weights the sample to adjust our survey to reflect population estimates; however, there were no important changes in the direction or significance of the variables in weighted specifications compared to unweighted sample specifications. Finally, we conclude it will take some years for members to understand the cooperative guidelines thoroughly and the potential of the cooperative approach to improve economic conditions. Also, there should be a serious attempt from the government to develop the agricultural infrastructure and industry, and to execute a cooperative policy to reduce smallholders&apos; poverty.
